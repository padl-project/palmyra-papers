	abstract = {Widespread geographic distribution of sponges should be rare, mainly because of the low dispersal capacity of their larvae and asexual products. Here we investigate the potential wide-scale distribution range in one marine sponge, Gelliodes wilsoni, that has been spread widely around the Pacific Rim by shipping. The species was originally described from the Philippines (western Pacific Ocean) by Wilson in 1925 as Gelliodes fibrosa. Recently, similar specimens have been collected from Guam (western Pacific Ocean), Hawaii, Palmyra Atoll (central Pacific Ocean), Acapulco Bay and Baja Peninsula (eastern Pacific Ocean). This species now appears to be widely distributed across the Pacific Ocean, and this distribution seems unlikely to have resulted from an extremely high dispersal capability; it is most likely the result of centuries of trans-Pacific shipping. We also propose the new name G. wilsoni for the species G. fibrosa originally described by Wilson because the same name was previously used by Dendy in 1905 to describe a species from Sri Lanka, which is morphologically different from the species described by Wilson. The case of G. wilsoni is not unique because several sponges (discussed here) have similar distribution patterns across the Pacific (at locations more than 10,000 km apart). This suggests an east–west connectivity and that widespread distribution in sponges is indeed possible, albeit the result of human activities. In an increasingly connected world our research highlights the importance of understanding connectivity across oceanic scales in order to predict where invasive species are likely to occur.},

Our results indicate that wave energy is primarily from the north during the northern hemisphere winter and from the south in the northern hemisphere summer. Refraction of waves along the reef terraces due to variations in bathymetry leads to focusing of waves in specific locations. Bottom friction, modeled with a modified bottom roughness formulation, is the significant source of wave energy dissipation on the atoll, a result that is consistent with available observations of wave damping on Palmyra. Indeed modeled wave dissipation rates from bottom friction are on average larger than dissipation rates due to breaking and are an order of magnitude larger than what has been observed on other, less geometrically complex reefs, a result which should be corroborated with future in situ measurements. The SWAN wave model with a modified bottom friction formulation better predicts bulk wave energy properties than the existing formulation at our measurement stations. The near bed squared velocity, a proxy for bottom stress, shows strong spatial variability across the atoll and exerts control over geomorphic structure and benthic community composition.},

	title = {Using {Stable} {Isotope} {Analysis} to {Assess} the {Foraging} {Habits} of {Palmyra} {Atoll} {Green} {Turtles} ({Chelonia} mydas)},
	url = {https://georgehbalazs.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/EBKelly-Thesis_FINAL-THESIS.pdf},
	abstract = {Juvenile green turtles (Chelonia mydas) undergo an ontogenetic habitat shift to neritic
developmental grounds after an initial period of development in the pelagic environment. Post-
pelagic juveniles are believed to undergo a switch from omnivory to herbivory upon recruitment
to foraging grounds. However, recent evidence suggests that some populations of green turtles
may not undergo direct ontogenetic habitat and dietary shifts and may continue to supplement
their herbivorous diet with animal products into adulthood. The individual and population level
variability of this shift has not been extensively studied and further support is needed to
substantiate if these are widespread phenomena. The Palmyra Atoll National Wildlife Refuge
(PANWR), a remote uninhabited atoll in the central Pacific, currently serves as a mixed-stage
foraging ground for juvenile, subadult and adult green turtles, yet little is known about the
ecology of this population. The presence and timing of ontogenetic shifts, stage-specific foraging
habits, and spatial variation in foraging habits, are all unresolved questions regarding of green
turtle foraging ecology in the Palmyra Atoll population.
Stable isotopes of carbon (! 13 C) and nitrogen (! 15 N) provide information on diet and
trophic position allowing for a more thorough understanding of the ontogeny of Palmyra Atoll
green turtle foraging behavior. The carapace, or dorsal section of a sea turtle shell, is composed
of keratin covered bony plates called scutes. Scute tissue is often used for isotopic studies
because keratin is metabolically inactive thus retaining the isotopic signature of the assimilated
elements of the diet from the time of tissue synthesis. Isotopic signatures of successive scute
layers may therefore be analyzed to identify when dietary shifts occur during recruitment to
foraging grounds. In addition, comparison of isotopic signatures in the most recently deposited
tissue layer allows for examination of spatial variation and stage-specific foraging habits in the
Palmyra Atoll population.
Two scute biopsy samples, posterior (oldest tissue) and anterior (younger tissue), were
collected from live-captured green turtle from 2008 to 2010. Size classes were determined using
curved carapace length (CCL) as a proxy for age resulting in juvenile (30.0 – 64.9 cm CCL),
sub-adult (65 – 84.9 CCL) and adult (85 - 120 CCL) size classes. A total of 28 juveniles, 26 sub-
adults and 21 adults were sampled. Prey items, such as epiphytic turf algae, macroalgae and
sponges, were also collected for stable isotope analyses.
Analysis of the ! 13 C and ! 15 N values of successive 50 μm layers from juvenile posterior
biopsy samples (n = 17) allowed for examination of resource use over time, providing insight on
the timing of ontogenetic shifts. Analysis of layer isotopic signatures using a linear mixed model
provided insight on the timing of ontogenetic shifts. In addition, the ! 13 C and ! 15 N values of the
most recently deposited tissue layer (i.e. inner anterior layer, n = 75) were used to examine stage-
specific habits and describe spatial variation in foraging habits.
Palmyra Atoll juvenile green turtles do not exhibit ! 15 N values that could be attributed to
a drop in trophic level or a switch from omnivory to herbivory. It is possible that the enriched
nitrogen found in algae is helping to maintain the enriched nitrogen levels seen in recent juvenile green turtle recruits. High levels of individual variation in layer ! 13 C and ! 15 N suggest that this
may be a generalist population. In addition, differing ! 15 N signatures among size classes
(Kruskal-Wallis, p = 0.001) suggests that individuals may forage at different trophic levels.
Enriched ! 15 N signatures may signify ingestion of animal products. These stage-specific habits
appear to be related to habitat selection preferences as individual size distribution differs
between the four sampling regions (CCL: Kruskal-Wallis, F = 8.937, df = 3, p = 0.030; Mass:
Kruskal-Wallis, F = 10.979, df = 3, p = 0.012); this could be due to habitat preferences or to
distinct dietary items consumed in the atoll regions. The Palmyra Atoll population contains
individuals that likely utilize a more variable and complex dietary repertoire including
omnivorous prey items.
Distribution of ! 13 C signatures did not differ across size classes (Kruskal-Wallis, p =
0.808) however ! 15 N values did differ across size classes (Kruskal-Wallis, p = 0.001); subadults
being less enriched in nitrogen than adults (Mann-Whitney U p {\textless} 0.001) and juveniles (Mann-
Whitney U p {\textless} 0.05). Size class distribution and ! 15 N values differ between sampling locations
suggesting some spatial structure to the Palmyra foraging grounds.
Using ! 13 C and ! 15 N ratios to determine the spatial and temporal variation in sea turtle
foraging habitat will help fill an important gap in our knowledge of sea turtle ecology and
identify critical areas for sea turtle habitat conservation at Palmyra Atoll. This study will also
contribute to a better understanding of the variation in ontogenetic diet shifts of juvenile greensea turtles as they recruit to neritic foraging grounds.},

Here high-resolution acoustic cameras are demonstrated as effective tools to study the ecology and behavior of reef and coastal sharks that operate in the vicinity of a near-pristine coral reef atoll. The acoustic camera generated detailed imagery and size measurements from {\textgreater}1000 sightings of sharks that traversed a discrete corridor linking two of the atoll's distinct marine habitats, the forereef and offshore pelagic habitat with the atoll's lagoon. Daily shark density and estimated biomass values varied considerably through time, but generally approximated values calculated using less comprehensive and more labor-intensive techniques at this same atoll. Diel patterns in shark movements revealed elevated shark presence during low-light periods of the day (e.g. peak sighting density just after dusk), but weaker links between shark movement patterns and tides. Data gathered through use of this tool extends and reinforces some of the observations made of smaller numbers of sharks using traditional data collection methods while providing unique additional insights into the ways that larger numbers of sharks operate at fine spatial scales over longer periods of time. Behavioral information of this type is critical to developing effective management plans for these vulnerable species.},

Living colonies of E. rostrata have been collected using the PISCES submersibles from three locations from 480 to 788m water depth in the Line Islands (∼160°W) in the Equatorial Pacific. We have applied to these colonies a high sensitivity, low blank technique to determine U-series ages in small quantities (70±15mg) of modern and near modern calcareous skeletons using MC-ICP-MS (Multi-collector Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer). The application of this method to living slow-growing colonies from a range of sites as well as the observations of axial growth patterns in thin sections of their skeletons offer the first expanded and well constrained data on longevity, growth pattern and mean growth rates in E. rostrata. Absolute dated specimens indicate life spans of colonies ranging from 209±8 yrs to 605±7 yrs with radial growth rates from 0.012 to 0.072mmyr−1 and vertical extension rates from 0.6 to 1.9mmyr−1. The linear growth rates reported here are lower than those reported for other deep-sea scleractinian corals (Lophelia pertusa and Madrepora oculata). The U-series dating indicates that the growth ring patterns of E. rostrata are not consistent with annual periodicity emphasizing the importance of absolute radiometric dating methods to constrain growth rates. Slow accretion and extreme longevity make this species and its habitat especially vulnerable to disturbances and impacts from human activities. This dating method combined with observation of growth patterns opens up new perspectives in the field of deep-sea corals since it can provide quantitative estimates of growth rates and longevity of deep-sea corals in general.},

In English, English abstract.The main traits of the rich equatorial vegetation covering the remote coral atoll Palmyra in North Pacific Ocean, where groves of Cocos nucifera L. (Arecaceae) currently dominate on other formations, are here summoned. Way and timing of human activities in historical and more recent times, which possibly altered the original vegetation, are also briefly reviewed. The unusually large size of Palmyra coconut fruits had astonished the American botanist Joseph Francis Rock (1884–1962) who sent four fruits to the renowned Florentine palm specialist Odoardo Beccari (1843–1920). Beccari described the material and validly published it in 1916 as Cocos nucifera f. palmyrensis Becc. Part of the original material was retrieved at FI. One of the two coconut fruits still kept at FI is here designated as lectotype of the Beccari name, which is here elevated to the rank of variety, reflecting better than form current concepts for isolated island populations. Palmyra Atoll with its coconuts played a part in the age-old dispute on the geographical origin of Cocos nucifera. This taxon was cited by Beccari and by Emilio Chiovenda (1871–1941) as a support to their hypotheses of an Asian origin of the species. The significance of these dated interpretations in the light of currently available information is here briefly discussed.Received: October 16, 2019; Accepted: February 4, 2020; First published online: March 24, 2020},

Using mass-spectrometry-guided fractionation together with molecular networking, cyanobacterial field collections from American Samoa and Palmyra Atoll yielded three new cyclic peptides, tutuilamides A–C. Their structures were established by spectroscopic techniques including 1D and 2D NMR, HR-MS, and chemical derivatization. Structure elucidation was facilitated by employing advanced NMR techniques including nonuniform sampling in combination with the 1,1-ADEQUATE experiment. These cyclic peptides are characterized by the presence of several unusual residues including 3-amino-6-hydroxy-2-piperidone and 2-amino-2-butenoic acid, together with a novel vinyl chloride-containing residue. Tutuilamides A–C show potent elastase inhibitory activity together with moderate potency in H-460 lung cancer cell cytotoxicity assays. The binding mode to elastase was analyzed by X-ray crystallography revealing a reversible binding mode similar to the natural product lyngbyastatin 7. The presence of an additional hydrogen bond with the amino acid backbone of the flexible side chain of tutuilamide A, compared to lyngbyastatin 7, facilitates its stabilization in the elastase binding pocket and possibly explains its enhanced inhibitory potency.},

Quantifying home range is critical for conservation, and can enable the use of concepts such as ‘umbrella species’, whose conservation protects other species due to shared habitat. To determine the value of the humphead wrasse as an umbrella species for coral reef conservation, we conducted a multi-year study of humphead wrasse home range at Palmyra Atoll, Central Tropical Pacific, tagging juvenile, female, and male individuals with acoustic transmitters. We quantified home range using 2 metrics, length and area, and determined if these metrics were related to the sex and maturity status of the individual. We recorded individual movements during 5030 fish-days, yielding detailed records for 14 individuals comprising 3 juveniles, 5 females, and 6 males. The home range of humphead wrasse measured over a 2 yr study was 0.4 to 14 km and changed with ontogeny. Females had larger home ranges than other reef fishes studied to date (n = 68), indicating value as an umbrella species for coral reefs. We compared the home range of the species to the size distribution of tropical marine protected areas (MPAs), and used a model to estimate the MPA length necessary to retain humphead wrasse. Most MPAs are too small to effectively protect the humphead wrasse.},

	abstract = {This study evaluates the accuracy of U/Th dates for young ({\textless} a few thousand years old) reef corals, both living and fossil, and explores strategies for refining those dates. The high precision of the U/Th method (±1–2\%) for dating young corals is well-established. Earlier studies have demonstrated the method’s accuracy for select samples of known age. However, these studies have focused on typical samples that have extremely low 232Th concentrations (tens of pg/g). Here we study the dating systematics of young corals that have low but significant amounts of 232Th (up to 1000 pg/g), indicating the presence of small fractions of non-radiogenic 230Th (i.e. 230Th not generated by in situ U decay). We report U/Th ages for living and subaerially exposed fossil corals from Palmyra Island, located in the central tropical Pacific, that range from 50 to 700 yr old. The Palmyra corals contain varying amounts of 232Th and small fractions of associated non-radiogenic 230Th. Uncertainty associated with the correction for non-radiogenic 230Th can lead to significant errors in U/Th dates. We have characterized non-radiogenic 230Th/232Th values, (230Th/232Th)nr, as a means of minimizing this source of error. We calculate (230Th/232Th)nr values ranging from 0 to 2×10−5 for the Palmyra living corals by comparing measured U/Th dates to absolute dates for the living coral, whose chronology is well-established. For the fossil corals, we employ three different approaches to arrive at (230Th/232Th)nr estimates. First, we compare measured U/Th dates to absolute dates in samples from a young fossil coral that overlaps the living coral. Next, we use the firm relative dating constraints imposed by five overlapping fossil corals from the 14th–15th centuries to calculate (230Th/232Th)nr values. Finally, we attempt to anchor the 14th–15th century floating coral chronology to an absolute chronology by correlating the climate signals in the coral records to those in absolutely dated climate proxy records. All lines of evidence point to a range of (230Th/232Th)nr for fossil corals that overlaps the range determined for the living coral, suggesting that most of the thorium is primary or is added while the coral is still alive. Our work also demonstrates the utility of multiple (230Th/232Th)nr estimates. Most importantly, we demonstrate a method by which accurate (±5 yr) U/Th-based chronologies can be obtained for young fossil corals with significant 232Th concentrations.},

	abstract = {Contaminants in the marine environment are widespread, but ship-based sampling routines are much narrower. We evaluated the utility of seabirds, highly-mobile marine predators, as broad samplers of contaminants throughout three tropical ocean regions. Our aim was to fill a knowledge gap in the distributions of, and processes that contribute to, tropical marine contaminants; and explore how species-specific foraging ecologies could inform or bias our understanding of contaminant distributions. Mercury and persistent organic pollutant (POPs) concentrations were measured in adults of five seabird species from four colonies in the central Pacific (Laysan and Tern Islands, Hawaii; Palmyra Atoll) and the eastern Caribbean (Barbuda). Blood-based total mercury (THg) and 89 POPs were measured in two seabird families: surface-foraging frigatebirds (Fregata spp.) and plunge-diving boobies (Sula spp.). Overall, largescale contaminant differences between colonies were more informative of contaminant distributions than inter-specific foraging ecology. Model selection results indicated that proximity to human populations was the best predictor of THg and POPs. Regional differences in contaminants were distinct: Barbudan Magnificent Frigatebirds had more compounds (n=52/89 POP detected) and higher concentrations (geometric mean THg=0.97μgg−1; mean ΣPOP53=26.6ngmL−1) than the remote colonies (34–42/89 POP detected; range of THg geometric means=0.33–0.93μgg−1; range of mean ΣPOP53:7.3–17.0ngmL−1) and had the most recently-synthesized POPs. Moderate differences in foraging ecologies were somewhat informative of inter-specific differences in contaminant types and concentrations between nearshore and offshore foragers. Across species, contaminant concentrations were higher in frigatebirds (THg=0.87μgg−1; ΣPOP53=17.5ngmL−1) compared to boobies (THg=0.48μgg−1; ΣPOP53=9.8). Ocean currents and contaminants' physiochemical properties provided additional insight into the scales of spatial and temporal contaminant exposure. Seabirds are excellent, broad samplers with which we can understand contaminant distributions in the marine environment. This is especially important for tropical remote regions that are under-sampled.},

Trophic cascades are often drastically disrupted by human interventions—for example, when wolves and cougars are removed, allowing deer and beaver to become destructive—yet have only recently begun to be considered in the development of conservation and management strategies.  Trophic Cascades is the first comprehensive presentation of the science on this subject. It brings together some of the world’s leading scientists and researchers to explain the importance of large animals in regulating ecosystems, and to relate that scientific knowledge to practical conservation.  Chapters examine trophic cascades across the world’s major biomes, including intertidal habitats, coastal oceans, lakes, nearshore ecosystems, open oceans, tropical forests, boreal and temperate ecosystems, low arctic scrubland, savannas, and islands. Additional chapters consider aboveground/belowground linkages, predation and ecosystem processes, consumer control by megafauna and fire, and alternative states in ecosystems. An introductory chapter offers a concise overview of trophic cascades, while concluding chapters consider theoretical perspectives and comparative issues.  Trophic Cascades provides a scientific basis and justification for the idea that large predators and top-down forcing must be considered in conservation strategies, alongside factors such as habitat preservation and invasive species. It is a groundbreaking work for scientists and managers involved with biodiversity conservation and protection.},

	abstract = {Native forests on tropical islands have been displaced by non-native species, leading to calls for their transformation. Simultaneously, there is increasing recognition that tropical forests can help sequester carbon that would otherwise enter the atmosphere. However, it is unclear if native forests sequester more or less carbon than human-altered landscapes. At Palmyra Atoll, efforts are underway to transform the rainforest composition from coconut palm (Cocos nucifera) dominated to native mixed-species. To better understand how this landscape-level change will alter the atoll’s carbon dynamics, we used field sampling, remote sensing, and parameter estimates from the literature to model the total carbon accumulation potential of Palmyra’s forest before and after transformation. The model predicted that replacing the C. nucifera plantation with native species would reduce aboveground biomass from 692.6 to 433.3 Mg C. However, expansion of the native Pisonia grandis and Heliotropium foertherianum forest community projected an increase in soil carbon to at least 13,590.8 Mg C, thereby increasing the atoll’s overall terrestrial carbon storage potential by 11.6\%. Nearshore sites adjacent to C. nucifera canopy had a higher dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration (110.0 μMC) than sites adjacent to native forest (81.5 μMC), suggesting that, in conjunction with an increase in terrestrial carbon storage, replacing C. nucifera with native forest will reduce the DOC exported from the forest into in nearshore marine habitats. Lower DOC levels have potential benefits for corals and coral dependent communities. For tropical islands like Palmyra, reverting from C. nucifera dominance to native tree dominance could buffer projected climate change impacts by increasing carbon storage and reducing coral disease.},

	abstract = {Abstract The possible role that tropical Pacific SSTs played in driving the megadroughts over North America during the medieval period is addressed. Fossil coral records from the Palmyra Atoll are used to derive tropical Pacific SSTs for the period from a.d. 1320 to a.d. 1462 and show overall colder conditions as well as extended multidecadal La Niña–like states. The reconstructed SSTs are used to force a 16-member ensemble of atmosphere GCM simulations, each with different initial conditions, with the atmosphere coupled to a mixed layer ocean outside of the tropical Pacific. Model results are verified against North American tree ring reconstructions of the Palmer Drought Severity Index. A singular value decomposition analysis is performed using the soil moisture anomaly simulated by another 16-member ensemble of simulations forced by global observed SSTs for 1856–2004 and tree ring reconstructions of the Palmer Drought Severity Index for the same period. This relationship is used to transfer the modeled medieval soil moisture anomaly (relative to the modern simulation) into a model-estimated Palmer Drought Severity Index. The model-estimated Palmer Drought Severity Index reproduces many aspects of both the interannual and decadal variations of the tree ring reconstructions, in addition to an overall drier climate that is drier than the tree ring records suggest. The model-estimated Palmer Drought Severity Index simulates two previously identified “megadroughts,” a.d. 1360–1400 and a.d. 1430–60, with a realistic spatial pattern and amplitude. In contrast, the model fails to produce a period of more normal conditions in the early fifteenth century that separated these two megadroughts. The dynamical link between tropical SSTs and the North American megadroughts is akin to that operating in modern droughts. The model results are used to argue that the tropical Pacific played an active role in driving the megadroughts. However, the match between simulated and reconstructed hydroclimate is such that it is likely that both the coral-reconstructed SST anomalies contain significant errors and that SST anomalies in other basins also played a role in driving hydroclimate variations over North America during the late medieval period.},

	abstract = {Reef-building corals are mixotrophic organisms that can obtain nutrition from endosymbiotic microalgae (autotrophy) and particle capture (heterotrophy). Heterotrophic nutrition is highly beneficial to many corals, particularly in times of stress. Yet, the extent to which different coral species rely on heterotrophic nutrition remains largely unknown because it is challenging to quantify. We developed a quantitative approach to investigate coral nutrition using carbon isotope (δ13C) analysis of six essential amino acids (AAESS) in a common Indo-Pacific coral (Pocillopora meandrina) from the fore reef habitat of Palmyra Atoll. We sampled particulate organic matter (POM) and zooplankton as the dominant heterotrophic food sources in addition to the coral host and endosymbionts. We also measured bulk tissue carbon (δ13C) and nitrogen (δ15N) isotope values of each sample type. Patterns among δ13C values of individual AAESS provided complete separation between the autotrophic (endosymbionts) and heterotrophic nutritional sources. In contrast, bulk tissue δ13C and δ15N values were highly variable across the putative food sources and among the coral and endosymbiont fractions, preventing accurate estimates of coral nutrition on Palmyra. We used linear discriminant analysis to quantify differences among patterns of AAESS δ13C values, or ‘fingerprints’, of the food resources available to corals. This allowed for the development of a quantitative continuum of coral nutrition that can identify the relative contribution of autotrophic and heterotopic nutrition to individual colonies. Our approach revealed exceptional variation in conspecific colonies at scales of metres to kilometres. On average, 41\% of AAESS in P. meandrina on Palmyra are acquired via heterotrophy, but some colonies appear capable of obtaining the majority of AAESS from one source or the other. The use of AAESS δ13C fingerprinting analysis offers a significant improvement on the current methods for quantitatively assessing coral trophic ecology. We anticipate that this approach will facilitate studies of coral nutrition in the field, which are essential for comparing coral trophic ecology across taxa and multiple spatial scales. Such information will be critical for understanding the role of heterotrophic nutrition in coral resistance and/or resilience to ongoing environmental change.

	abstract = {Fisheries provide protein for over three billion people and add \$150 billion to our economies each year. Their sustainability is critical for the health of marine ecosystem and the fishing communities that rely on them. Yet, our ability to monitor global fisheries – to understand impacts on threatened species, to reduce illegal fishing and labor abuses, and to ensure compliance with fisheries management regulations that maintain their viability – has been limited. Recent advances in satellite technology and big data analytics now permit direct, near real-time observation of most large fishing vessels (50-75\% of vessels {\textgreater} 24 meters). In this dissertation, my collaborators and I track fish and fishing vessels to evaluate current approaches for marine conservation and management. In particular, I focus on the movements of fish and fisheries relative to large marine protected area (MPA) boundaries, which are vast (France-sized) portions of our ocean that have recently been closed to fishing for conservation purposes. First, I tracked grey reef sharks and industrial fishing vessels to evaluate the effectiveness of a large MPA for reef shark conservation, finding that large MPAs can effectively protect this important predator. Next, I increased our scope by tracking the response of industrial fisheries to five large MPAs in the Pacific Ocean. We find that large MPAs successfully keep industrial fishing effort low relative to surrounding regions, but that effort was already very low within most large MPAs prior to protection, informing discussions on what large MPAs can and cannot be expected to do. Finally, we use animal telemetry, habitat models, and vessel tracking to predict where commercially-important and/or threatened species of sharks and tunas overlap with international fisheries in the northeast Pacific Ocean. We identified hotspots of overlap and revealed that the vast majority of predicted overlap between these fish and fisheries is driven by a small number of nations, which may guide ongoing negotiations about how to effectively manage mobile species in international waters. Following these investigations, I argue that new technology – often criticized for its role in increasing fisheries' efficiency and capacity for overfishing – holds great potential for resolving current and future obstacles to sustainable fisheries.},

Sediment samples from the lagoons and tidal zones were analyzed for grainsize and composition, and the results used to compile detailed maps and interpret the environments and lithofacies present. A distinct grainsize distribution was observed forming concentric bands ranging from coarse gravel rubble on the outer reef through to finer material in the interior of the atoll in the deep lagoons, where peloidal muds prevail. Five lithologic facies have been identified and typical sediments are poorly sorted and near-symmetrical in their grainsize distribution. On average, sediments are medium sand. A distinct chlorozoan assemblage was observed with coral and calcareous red algal fragments forming half of the sediment, with varying amounts of molluscs, Halimeda and foraminifera being the lesser major constituents. Lagoonal and tidal sediments showed little variation in composition between locations and lacked clear compositional zonation, characteristic of other larger atolls of the Pacific. 
Palmyra Atoll is unique in that it has had little human intervention for the last sixty years and as a result uninhibited natural processes are occurring. It is also unique in that it displays relatively deep for its size ({\textless}55 m), steep-sided compartmentalized lagoons that have abundant fine material (upward of 70\% silt or finer), a feature not commonly observed at other Pacific atolls. This fine material has been identified as a peloidal mud and its mode and rate of deposition may be partly controlled by the abundant zooplankton in the lagoons. Recent sediments of Palmyra Atoll are almost entirely carbonate, originating from reef organisms inhabiting the atoll. The only other material is small amounts of siliceous sponge skeletons.},

	abstract = {Coral reefs have been part of the earth’s oceans since the Mesozoic Era, over 200 million years ago. In recent decades, however, reefs have been progressively suffering as a result of human activities. However, coral species vary in their response to ecological disturbance. The work described here examines aspects of the biology of two central Pacific species: Porites superfusa, a small encrusting coral, and Acropora cytherea, a dynamic, massive table coral. Both species are perforate corals, with skeletons permeated with an extensive canal system partially lined with living coral tissue. Thus far, the question of whether the perforate coral condition conveys functional advantages lacking in corals with imperforate (relatively dense) skeletons has been overlooked. The present work supported with field work and sample collections at Palmyra Atoll, Line Islands, USA, during approximately annual visits of several weeks each from 2012 to 2016. The reef is protected from fishing and local pollution but still exposed to wide-scale disturbances like climate change (especially evident in warm water bleachings in 2009, 2015, 2016). This dissertation explores the importance of coral regrowth, endoliths and adjacent epiliths to reef recovery dynamics. Long-term changes in coverage of Porites superfusa were followed in a time series of high-resolution photoquadrats that demonstrated new settlement as well as changes in existing colonies (growth, partial mortality, death, and “death” followed by resurrection). Partial mortality and survival was usually observed in larger individuals, whereas smaller individuals tended to grow progressively or apparently die out completely. However, quite often a new small individual would appear in the area where a colony had died previously in the time series. Although settlement of planula larvae from the water column could not be completely ruled out, the source of new growth could have been from a small amount of living tissue cryptically surviving in or on the “dead” colony. Further work would be required to see if new growth was seeded by small regions of viable tissue. For the other perforate coral in this dissertation, Acropora cytherea, the distribution of living tissues was studied in the canals permeating the skeleton in healthy and evidently dead (algae-covered) regions of the colony. Core samples were studied by scanning electron and light microscopy. In healthy regions, the living coral tissues lined only the intraskeletal canals to a depth of several millimeters from the surface of the colony. In healthy parts of the colony, the canals more than a few millimeters deep in the colony were bounded not by living coral tissues, but with calcareous skeleton. Although the coral skeleton was riddled with endoliths (algae, fungi and bacteria), they were relatively rarely observed in the canal space. In regions where the living part of the colony was covered over with turf algae and other invading organisms, these endoliths were detected, along with abundant sediment, packing the most superficial intracellular canals; surprisingly the canals deeper beneath the overgrown region were free of such extraneous material. In the light of these results, one can speculate that fluid (driven by flagella in the relatively superficial healthy part of the colony) might percolate throughout the intraskeletal canal system, even in regions underlying places overgrown with algae and other organisms. Such a flow could conceivably distribute nutrients or coral cells to regions where they might influence the repair of the locally overgrown parts of the colony overlying them. Light microscopic and molecular techniques (internal transcribed spacers, ITS and 18S cDNA) were combined to provide an overview of the overgrowing and endolithic organisms associated with A. cytherea. The sampled regions of the colony were living, recently dead (near living coral tissue) or long dead (far from living coral tissue). The data permitted mostly genus-level identification of macroalgae, endolithic and epilithic algae, and endolithic fungi. A comparison between living, recently dead, and long dead samples demonstrated a succession in community composition of the algae. Even so, there were notable similarities in the genera of endolithic fungi present in the skeleton of living and dead regions of the colony. The endolithic communities within the coral may be a link between live and dead coral in the calcium carbonate structures. This might reflect a uniformity and connectivity maintained by the deep circulation within the unobstructed lumens of the intraskeletal canal system throughout the colony, even beneath superficially overgrown areas. In sum, the results of the different parts of this dissertation point to the need for further studies of the recently neglected perforate skeleton character and connecting endoliths and their possible relationship to resilience of some perforate corals. Understanding partial survival and dead coral skeleton may hold additional hints at maintaining and protecting coral reef ecosystems.},

We found that spatial variations in coral cover were correlated with temperature variations on time scales of days to weeks. Shallow terrace and backreef sites with high coral cover ({\textgreater} 50\%) had a highly variable temperature distributions, but their average weekly temperature distributions were lower and similar to offshore waters. The mechanism for maintaining this low weekly temperature was mean advection, which varied on a weekly timescale in response to wave forcing. Tides were also important in driving flow on the atoll, but their contribution to the net transport of heat was not significant. Wind and regional forcing were generally not important in driving flow inside the atoll. Buoyancy-driven flows were important within the lagoons, and in driving cross-shore exchange on forereef environments. The physical factors favoring high coral cover percentage varied according to the different prevailing hydrodynamic regimes: low temperatures in backreef habitats, short travel times in lagoon habitats (days since entering the reef system), and lower wave stress on forereef habitats. In light of future warming from climate change, local areas of reefs which maintain lower temperatures through wave-driven mean flows will have the best likelihood of promoting coral survival.},

	abstract = {Understanding the natural processes that drive resource distribution and the associated response of organisms is a principal goal in ecology. Mixotrophic organisms are particularly interesting in this regard because their fitness is linked to the resources essential for both primary producers (e.g., light and nutrients) and consumers (e.g., food). Reef-building corals are among the most widely distributed mixotrophs and form the foundation of one of the most productive and diverse marine ecosystems, coral reefs. To date, a disproportionate amount of research has focused on the role of endosymbiotic microalgae in defining coral nutrition and we have a limited understanding of how corals respond to variation in food availability through time and space. This dissertation examines how mixotrophic corals can modify their nutritional modes in accordance with resource availability at multiple spatial scales. The Southern Line Islands of Kiribati in the central Pacific Ocean span a known upwelling gradient and have distinct differences in nearshore primary production. Combining remotely sensed estimates of surface chl-a as a proxy for food availability and stable isotope analysis of a common coral species, I found that corals are more heterotrophic at more productive islands. I then extended this relationship globally by synthesizing published isotopic data on corals and found that large-scale patterns of chl-a can predict how heterotrophic corals are likely to be. I then developed a more precise method to studying coral trophic ecology at finer spatial scales. Using δ13C analysis of amino acids, I found extreme trophic plasticity (0–100\% contribution of heterotrophic nutrition) among conspecific corals at the scale of meters to kilometers around Palmyra Atoll. Finally, I conducted a nutrient enrichment experiment to examine the physiological responses of corals to changes in autotrophic nutrition in the absence of heterotrophic nutrition. I found that elevated nutrient concentrations have species-specific effects on coral calcification likely due to modifications in resource sharing between corals and their endosymbionts. Collectively, the results of my dissertation address a critical knowledge gap in coral biology and provide a framework to resolve the importance of heterotrophic nutrition in the persistence of coral reef ecosystems in an era of global change.},

Much remains unknown about the role of these various drivers in determining food chain length, and particularly about the mechanisms by which they may operate in terrestrial ecosystems, which have quite different ecological constraints than aquatic environments, where most food chain length studies have been thus far conducted. In this study, we tested the relative importance of ecosystem size and productivity in influencing food chain length in a terrestrial setting. We determined that (1) there is no effect of ecosystem size or productive space on food chain length; (2) rather, food chain length increases strongly and linearly with productivity; and (3) the observed changes in food chain length are likely achieved through a combination of changes in predator size, predator behavior, and consumer diversity along gradients in productivity. These results lend new insight into the mechanisms by which productivity can drive changes in food chain length, point to potential for systematic differences in the drivers of food web structure between terrestrial and aquatic systems, and challenge us to consider how ecological context may control the drivers that shape food chain length.},

This food web is unique in measuring the body sizes, densities, and feeding links for all life stages of free-living and parasitic metazoans. Chapter 1 puts the research in context by reviewing the roles of parasites in marine food webs. Chapter 2 starts by describing the physical attributes (sediment particle size, water depth, temperature) of the 35 random sampling sites. It then lists the 22 sampling methods used to estimate the body size and abundance of 670 life stages comprising 275 species. The resulting free-living community contains represents 195 free-living species across 18 phyla, and 389 separate life stages. Chapter 2 then describes how parasites were measured from {\textgreater}2500 hosts collected and dissected to reveal a parasite community with 80 species across 9 phyla, and 281 separate life stages. Chapter 3 then uses stomach contents, field observations, literature, and natural history to estimate 24,575 trophic interactions, ontogenetic development and parasite transmission pathways among the 670 nodes in Chapter 2. Chapter 4 compares the Palmyra sand flat food web with the only published food web described in similar detail, the west coast estuary food web. In both systems, parasites make contributions to richness, abundance, and biomass comparable to free-living consumer groups, such as birds. Further, in both systems parasites dominate network structure in ways that free-living consumers cannot. These results suggest that parasites make general and important contributions to ecosystem structure. Our understanding of food webs is incomplete without them.},

Here we present ICP-MS analyses of Pb of a core from a lagoon at Palmyra Atoll, northern Line Islands, that spans approximately the past 160years. The non-bioturbated sediments of the euxinic lagoon, coupled with rapid rates of deposition, provide a unique fine-scale record of atmospheric Pb supply at a remote Pacific location.

Within reef-building coral communities, these processes are especially important during the earliest life stages when reproduction provides mobility among sessile organisms and populations experience the greatest mortality bottlenecks both before and immediately after settlement. Here, we used large-area imaging to create photomosaics that allowed us to identify and map the location of 4681 juvenile (1–5 cm diameter) and 25 902 adult ({\textgreater}5 cm diameter) coral colonies from eight 100-m2 plots across the forereef of Palmyra Atoll. Using metrics of density, percent cover and the relative location of each colony within each plot, we examined abundance and spatial relationships between juvenile and adult coral taxa. Within coral taxa, juvenile density was generally positively related to the numerical density and percent cover of adults. Nearest neighbor analyses showed aggregation of juveniles near adults of the same taxon for two of the focal taxa (Pocillopora and Fungiids), while all other taxa showed random spatial patterning relative to adults. Three taxa had clustered distributions of juveniles overall. Additionally, we found that on a colony level, juveniles for five of nine focal taxa (accounting for {\textgreater}98\% of all identified juveniles) associated with a specific habitat type, with four of those five taxa favoring unconsolidated (e.g. rubble) over consolidated substrata. The general lack of clustering in juvenile corals contrasts with consistent clustering patterns seen in adult corals, suggesting that adult spatial patterns are largely driven by processes occurring after maturity such as partial colony mortality, including fission and fragmentation. The association of many taxa with unconsolidated habitat also suggests that corals may play an important role in colonizing natural rubble patches that could contribute to reef stabilization over time.},

	abstract = {Anthropogenic pressures, direct and indirect, have left no coral reef untouched. Those that remain in a near-pristine condition are remote islands and atolls removed from the majority of direct impacts, but even these are still subjected to the pressures of global climate change to which they are demonstrating a higher resilience than those which are already severely compromised. These near-pristine systems should be protected, managed and studied to better understand how they function and hopefully ensure the future of coral reefs. Unfortunately a number of the remote atolls and islands in the Pacific were modified or used by the US military during WWII, which altered these systems in unknown ways and threatened their surrounding reefs. Palmyra Atoll in the Central Pacific for example had its lagoons dredged and blocked to create more landmass for building, along with the creation of a channel through the reef to allow boat access into the lagoons making them susceptible to introduced species. Fortunately the surrounding reefs at Palmyra are still in a near-pristine condition with high densities of scleractinian corals, however the lagoon fauna is now predominantly sponges. Sponges in high enough densities can have considerable impacts on semi-enclosed bodies of water through their high filtering capabilities and could even threaten native species through competition if they were to extend onto non-lagoon reefs. Therefore, the broad aim of this thesis was to understand the ecology of the sponges in the lagoons at Palmyra and determine their potential impacts on the atoll directly and indirectly. To answer these questions I collected sponge assemblage data across the lagoons at both shallow and deep depths and sampled those species found on the reefs, which were surprisingly entirely different from the lagoon species. I then modelled a suite of environmental predictors to ascertain whether environmental conditions might be maintaining the sponges in the lagoon. To further examine whether the sponges were capable of extending onto the reef I also looked at larval recruitment patterns and assessed the temporal stability with semi-permanent quadrats. The initial surveys revealed the presence of at least two introduced species: Haliclona caerulea (Hechtel 1965) and Gelliodes fibrosa (Wilson 1925). Molecular tools were then employed to confirm the identification and attempt to ascertain the introduction pathway of H. caerulea. Finally, to assess the potential impact of the sponges on the water column I calculated the filtration rates of all the morphologies in the lagoon and extrapolated to the time required to clear all the available water in the lagoon as well as the removal rates of dissolved organic carbon and oxygen. 
 
Overall the lagoons appear to have undergone a phase-shift from a coral to sponge dominated system. However, the direct threat of the sponges extending onto the adjacent near-pristine reef currently seems negligible as they appear to be relatively “stable” (sponge mortality and recruitment are in equilibrium) and maintained in the lagoons by the environmental conditions, despite larval production. Sponge diversity changed over depths but the total number of species was consistent with other atoll systems despite the military modifications, with the most prominent sponge being a Hawaiian endemic species: Iotrochota protea (de Laubenfels 1950). The introduction of H. caerulea, a Caribbean sponge is thought to have occurred to Palmyra via Hawaiʻi; however, the molecular data also revealed further cryptic speciation at both the species and order levels, suggesting greater species diversity at Palmyra than previously believed. Finally, the indirect impacts of the sponges on the water column also appear to be small and with limited future risks to the reef organisms, as recruitment and mortality are currently in equilibrium and therefore unlikely to increase dramatically in percentage cover. Globally sponges can play important functional roles in semi-enclosed bodies of water and in summary, despite the sponges being the most dominant fauna on the hard substrate in the lagoons, they appear to pose little threat to the atoll and the adjacent reefs either directly or indirectly despite the confirmed introduction of non-endemic species. However, it must be noted that the time since the modification (70 years) is not that long in an evolutionary sense, so the sponges may still have the potential to extend onto the reef, particularly if there are any dramatic changes to the environmental conditions on the outer reefs. Therefore, to detect whether the sponges are extending onto the reef I propose, as a future management tool, the use of I. protea as an indicator species. The use of multidisciplinary approaches to answer important ecological questions with respect to the potential for sponges to have negative impacts on the nonlagoon reefs proved to be essential in understanding whether the modifications to the lagoons and the subsequent dominance of sponges could be threatening one of the last few remaining near-pristine reef systems in the world.},

	url = {https://escholarship.org/uc/item/6j11n9tq},
	abstract = {The removal of apex predators is widely recognized to have broad ecological consequences for terrestrial and aquatic communities. In marine systems, the direct effects of fisheries exploitation include altering the community standing stock (biomass), species composition, and size- structure of the fish assemblage. Although the direct effects of fisheries exploitation are well documented, there is increasing evidence that the non-lethal effects of predation can also strongly influence the structure and function of ecological communities. In this dissertation I set out to increase our understanding of the effects of predators on coral reef fish assemblages by conducting a series of large-scale natural experiments across groups of Pacific islands spanning gradients of human population density and oceanographic productivity within four distinct geopolitical regions. My dissertation research reveals striking evidence for the effects of fisheries exploitation and oceanographic productivity on coral reef fish assemblages in three key areas. First, I found strong evidence that the effects of fisheries exploitation are not restricted to large-bodied species from higher-trophic levels but are realized throughout the entire fish assemblage and across multiple trophic groups. Importantly, I show that multiple forms of fisheries exploitation may be present on coral reefs, indicating the complex nature of coral reef fisheries. Second, I show strong evidence of biophysical coupling with gradients of oceanographic productivity and alterations in predatory fish abundance on the body condition, growth rates, maximum size, and longevity of coral reef fishes. I also observe a breakdown of natural coupling at inhabited islands, suggesting that local human impacts are capable of homogenizing life history traits of fishes even when strong environmental gradients are present. Third, I show that the trophic structure of coral reef fish assemblages are more tightly linked to changes in oceanographic productivity than to predatory fish abundance. I observed trophic channeling, a process by which different basal sources of energy entering the system can remain isolated on coral reefs forming distinct pathways up through the food web to top- level carnivores. In summary, my dissertation provides important insight into the mechanisms that structure marine communities and the direct and indirect effects of removing predators from marine ecosystems},

This paper examines the ecological correlation between C. nucifera abundance and changes in forest structure, floristic diversity and forest soil characteristics. Location: Palmyra Atoll NWR (USA), Central Pacific Ocean. Methods: Plant surveys were conducted on 83 transects (each 100 m2). All plants ≥5 cm in height were identified and counted; large plants were also measured and ground cover was surveyed. Major macronutrients, pH, macro-elements/base cations, micronutrients and pedogenic elements, and thermodynamic stability levels were quantified from soil samples taken at each transect. Results: Even in a low diversity atoll environment, we found that high abundances of C. nucifera corresponded with pronounced differences in forest communities including: lower diversity of established trees and regenerating understorey; higher stem density and stand basal area; lower abundance of major macronutrients; and differences in macro and trace elements and energy content of soil organic matter. Historical natural experiments document that the expansion of C. nucifera was the likely causative agent of these changes. Discussion: Cumulatively, these data show that C. nucifera has important impacts on floristic, structural and soil characteristics of forests where it becomes dominant. Given the high proportion of tropical coastal areas in which C. nucifera is now naturalized and abundant, this likely has important implications for coastal forest diversity and structure.},

	abstract = {This 'Terrestrial Forest Management Plan for Palmyra Atoll' was developed by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) for The Nature Conservancy (TNC) Palmyra Program to refine and expand goals and objectives developed through the Conservation Action Plan process. It is one in a series of adaptive management plans designed to achieve TNC's mission toward the protection and enhancement of native wildlife and habitat. The 'Terrestrial Forest Management Plan for Palmyra Atoll' focuses on ecosystem integrity and specifically identifies and addresses issues related to assessing the status and distribution of resources, as well as the pressures acting upon them, most specifically nonnative and potentially invasive species. The plan, which presents strategies for increasing ecosystem integrity, provides a framework to implement and track the progress of conservation and restoration goals related to terrestrial resources on Palmyra Atoll. The report in its present form is intended to be an overview of what is known about historical and current forest resources; it is not an exhaustive review of all available literature relevant to forest management but an attempt to assemble as much information specific to Palmyra Atoll as possible. Palmyra Atoll is one of the Northern Line Islands in the Pacific Ocean southwest of the Hawai`ian Islands. It consists of many heavily vegetated islets arranged in a horseshoe pattern around four lagoons and surrounded by a coral reef. The terrestrial ecosystem consists of three primary native vegetation types: Pisonia grandis forest, coastal strand forest, and grassland. Among these vegetation types, the health and extent of Pisonia grandis forest is of particular concern. Overall, the three vegetation types support 25 native plant species (two of which may be extirpated), 14 species of sea birds, six shore birds, at least one native reptile, at least seven native insects, and six native land crabs. Green and hawksbill turtles forage at Palmyra Atoll, and though rarely documented, beach nesting could be affected by terrestrial management actions. There are various nonnative or invasive species throughout the terrestrial ecosystem. The most notable examples of terrestrial invasive species include coconut palms (Cocos nucifera) and black rats (Rattus rattus). Although it is unclear whether they are nonnative, coconut palms are currently the most dominant plant across Palmyra Atoll. They compete with native plant species for space and resources and are potentially detrimental to sea birds dependent on native vegetation for roosting and nesting habitat. This competition in turn impacts nutrient resource availability, thereby reshaping energy flow in the ecosystem. Black rats are known to prey on ground-nesting sea birds and are likely responsible for the lack of burrowing sea bird reproduction at Palmyra Atoll. In addition, they may be facilitating the invasion of other nonnative species and negatively impacting other native fauna. Although the},

Here we examined the temporal variability and recruitment rates of these sponge assemblages to determine if they are stable and examined the evidence that a recent transition has occurred from a coral- to sponge-dominated system. We found 24 sponge species in permanent quadrats in the lagoon between 2009 and 2011, and 11 species on our recruitment panels. The sponge assemblage composition and abundance did not vary significantly between years and appear stable. Many sponge recruits were found in both years that the panels were examined although higher rates were recorded in the second year of the study. While it seems very possible that a change to a sponge-dominated lagoon is associated with declining environmental quality at Palmyra as a result of modifications over 70 years ago, without pre-modification data on reef assemblage composition this remains speculative. Our observations of short-term temporal stability in the sponge assemblages at Palmyra highlight the potential for sponge-dominated reef states to be maintained in degraded reef environments that are seemingly unsuitable for coral survival.},

The only strong and consistent factor associated with the mean abundance of nematodes in rats was habitat (dominant cover and locally dominant plant species).

Here we report on the isotope signatures in green sea-turtle (\textit{Chelonia mydas}) barnacles (\textit{Platylepas} sp.) and discuss their potential relevance as tools with which to study green sea turtle migration and habitat use patterns. We analyzed oxygen (δ$^{\textrm{18}}$O) and carbon (δ$^{\textrm{13}}$C) isotope ratios in barnacle calcite layers from specimens collected from green turtles captured at the Palmyra Atoll National Wildlife Refuge (PANWR) in the central Pacific. Carbon isotopes were not informative in this study. However, the oxygen isotope results suggest likely regional movement patterns when mapped onto a predictive oxygen isotope map of the Pacific. Barnacle proxies could therefore complement other methods in understanding regional movement patterns, informing more effective conservation policy that takes into account connectivity between populations.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Invasive rats have colonized most of the islands of the world, resulting in strong negative impacts on native biodiversity and on ecosystem functions. As prolific omnivores, invasive rats can cause local extirpation of a wide range of native species, with cascading consequences that can reshape communities and ecosystems. Eradication of rats on islands is now becoming a widespread approach to restore ecosystems, and many native island species show strong numerical responses to rat eradication. However, the effect of rat eradication on other consumers can extend beyond direct numerical effects, to changes in behavior, dietary composition, and other ecological parameters. These behavioral and trophic effects may have strong cascading impacts on the ecology of restored ecosystems, but they have rarely been examined. In this study, we explore how rat eradication has affected the trophic ecology of native land crab communities. Using stable isotope analysis of rats and crabs, we demonstrate that the diet or trophic position of most crabs changed subsequent to rat eradication. Combined with the numerical recovery of two carnivorous land crab species (Geograpsus spp.), this led to a dramatic widening of the crab trophic niche following rat eradication. Given the established importance of land crabs in structuring island communities, particularly plants, this suggests an unappreciated mechanism by which rat eradication may alter island ecology. This study also demonstrates the potential for stable isotope analysis as a complementary monitoring tool to traditional techniques, with the potential to provide more nuanced assessments of the community- and ecosystem-wide effects of restoration.},

Recent OA studies have demonstrated negative and/or differential effects of reduced pH on growth, development, calcification and physiology, but most of these have focused on taxa other than calcareous benthic macroalgae. Here we investigate the potential effects of OA on one of the most common coral reef macroalgal genera, Halimeda. Species of Halimeda produce a large proportion of the sand in the tropics and are a major contributor to framework development on reefs because of their rapid calcium carbonate production and high turnover rates. On Palmyra Atoll in the central Pacific, we conducted a manipulative bubbling experiment to investigate the potential effects of OA on growth, calcification and photophysiology of 2 species of Halimeda. Our results suggest that Halimeda is highly susceptible to reduced pH and aragonite saturation state but the magnitude of these effects is species specific. H. opuntia suffered net dissolution and 15\% reduction in photosynthetic capacity, while H. taenicola did not calcify but did not alter photophysiology in experimental treatments. The disparate responses of these species to elevated CO2 partial ­pressure (pCO2) may be due to anatomical and physiological differences and could represent a shift in their relative dominance in the face of OA. The ability for a species to exert biological control over calcification and the species specific role of the carbonate skeleton may have important implications for the potential effects of OA on ecological function in the future.},

	abstract = {Spatial separation within predator communities can arise via territoriality but also from competitive interactions among and within species. However, linking competitive interactions to predator distribution patterns is difficult and theoretical models predict different habitat selection patterns dependent on habitat quality and how competition manifests itself. While models generally consider competitors to be either equal in ability, or for one phenotype to have a fixed advantage over the other, few studies consider that an animal may only have a competitive advantage in specific habitats. We used  10 years of telemetry data, habitat surveys and behavioral experiments, to show spatial partitioning between and within two species of reef shark (grey reef Carcharhinus amblyrhinchos and blacktip reef sharks C. melanopterus) at an unfished Pacific atoll. Within a species, sharks remained within small ‘sub-habitats’ with very few movements of individuals between sub-habitats, which previous models have suggested could be caused by intra-specific competition. Blacktip reef sharks were more broadly distributed across habitat types but a greater proportion used lagoon and backreef habitats, while grey reef sharks preferred forereef habitats. Grey reef sharks at a nearby atoll where blacktip reef sharks are absent, were distributed more broadly between habitat types than when both species were present. A series of individual-based models predict that habitat separation would only arise if there are competitive interactions between species that are habitat-specific, with grey reefs having a competitive advantage on the forereefs and blacktips in the lagoons and backreef. We provide compelling evidence that competition helps drive distribution patterns and spatial separation of a marine predator community, and highlight that competitive advantages may not be constant but rather dependent on habitats.},

	abstract = {Coral and algal holobionts are assemblages of macroorganisms and microorganisms, including viruses, Bacteria, Archaea, protists and fungi. Despite a decade of research, it remains unclear whether these associations are spatial–temporally stable or species-specific. We hypothesized that conflicting interpretations of the data arise from high noise associated with sporadic microbial symbionts overwhelming signatures of stable holobiont members. To test this hypothesis, the bacterial communities associated with three coral species (Acropora rosaria, Acropora hyacinthus and Porites lutea) and two algal guilds (crustose coralline algae and turf algae) from 131 samples were analyzed using a novel statistical approach termed the Abundance-Ubiquity (AU) test. The AU test determines whether a given bacterial species would be present given additional sampling effort (that is, stable) versus those species that are sporadically associated with a sample. Using the AU test, we show that coral and algal holobionts have a high-diversity group of stable symbionts. Stable symbionts are not exclusive to one species of coral or algae. No single bacterial species was ubiquitously associated with one host, showing that there is not strict heredity of the microbiome. In addition to the stable symbionts, there was a low-diversity community of sporadic symbionts whose abundance varied widely across individual holobionts of the same species. Identification of these two symbiont communities supports the holobiont model and calls into question the hologenome theory of evolution.},

	abstract = {We conducted in situ diver surveys describing the spatial structure of reef fish assemblages at Kingman Reef, an unexploited and remote atoll in the central North Pacific. Structural patterns reflect natural ecological processes that are not influenced by fishing or other anthropogenic factors. The most striking feature of this assemblage is an inverted biomass pyramid dominated by apex predators, primarily sharks and large snappers, across all depth and habitat strata examined. This pattern is most pronounced at greater depths (20 m) on the fore reef. Apex predators dominated to lesser extents in back-reef, patch-reef, and shallow fore-reef habitats. Prey assemblage size spectra showed fewer large prey and greater numbers of prey from small size classes at locations with greater piscivore biomass. Other patterns of prey abundance generally conformed to those previously observed at more commonly encountered, human-altered reefs (e.g. highest herbivore abundance on back reefs and shallower depths on the fore reefs; greater planktivore prevalence deeper on the fore reef). The latter patterns, however, inadvertently miss the less obvious differences in assemblage dynamics that result from alterations in the size structures of prey fish populations where apex predators have been heavily exploited or extirpated. The present study of a fully intact coral reef suggests that (1) piscivores are common across all habitats and depths, (2) the presence of predators does not lead to appreciable reductions in the biomass of other guilds, and (3) predators alter the size structure and therefore the potential productivity and energy flow of the ecosystem.},

Here we addressed this for the first time using spatially expansive and thematically resolved benthic community data collected around five uninhabited central Pacific oceanic islands, spanning 6° latitude and 17° longitude. Using towed-diver digital image surveys over 140 linear km of shallow (8–20 m depth) tropical reef, we highlight the autocorrelated nature of coral reef seascapes. Benthic functional groups and hard coral morphologies displayed significant spatial clustering (positive autocorrelation) up to kilometre-scales around all islands, in some instances dominating entire sections of coastline. The scale and strength of these autocorrelation patterns showed differences across geographies, but patterns were more similar between islands in closer proximity and of a similar size. For example, crustose coralline algae (CCA) were clustered up to scales of 0.3 km at neighbouring Howland and Baker Islands and macroalgae were spatially clustered at scales up to 3 km at both neighbouring Kingman Reef and Palmyra Atoll. Of all the functional groups, macroalgae had the highest levels of spatial clustering across geographies at the finest resolution of our data (100 m). There were several cases where the upper scale at which benthic community members showed evidence of spatial clustering correlated highly with the upper scales at which concurrent gradients in physical environmental drivers were spatially clustered. These correlations were stronger for surface wave energy than subsurface temperature (regardless of benthic group) and turf algae and CCA had the closest alignments in scale with wave energy across functional groups and geographies. Our findings suggest such physical drivers not only limit or promote the abundance of various benthic competitors on coral reefs, but also play a key role in governing their spatial scaling properties across seascapes.},

Palmyra Atoll allows us to study disease dynamics under near-pristine, functionally intact conditions. We examined disease prevalence among all known species of scleractinian coral, soft coral and zoanthid (Palythoa) at a variety of coral reef habitats at Palmyra over a 2 yr period. In 2008, overall disease prevalence across the atoll was low (0.33\%), but higher on the shallower backreef (0.88\%) and reef terrace (0.80\%) than on the deeper forereef (0.09\%). Scleractinian coral disease prevalence was higher (0.30\%) than were soft coral and zoanthid disease (0.03\% combined). Growth anomalies (GAs) were the most commonly encountered lesions, with scleractinian species in the genera Astreopora (2.12\%), Acropora (1.30\%), and Montipora (0.98\%) showing the highest prevalence atoll-wide. Discoloration necrosis (DN) was most prevalent in the zoanthid Palythoa tuberculosa (1.18\%), although the soft coral Sinularia and Montipora also had a prevalence of 0.44 and 0.01\%, respectively. Overall disease prevalence within permanently marked transects increased from 0.65\% in 2008 to 0.79\% in 2009. Palythoa DN contributed most to this increased prevalence, which coincided with rising temperatures during the 2009 El Niño. GAs on the majority of susceptible genera at Palmyra increased in number over time, and led to tissue death. Host distribution and environmental factors (e.g. temperature) appear to be important for determining spatiotemporal patterns of disease at Palmyra. More sophisticated analyses are required to tease apart the likely inter-correlated proximate drivers of disease occurrence on remote, near-pristine reefs.},

For example, The Palmyra Atoll National Wildlife Refuge harbors one of the few surviving native stands of Pisonia grandis in the central Pacific Ocean, yet these trees face pressure from groundwater salinization, with little basic groundwater data to guide decision making. Adding to natural complexity, the geology of Palmyra was heavily altered by dredge and fill activities. Our study based at this atoll combines geophysical and hydrological field measurements from 2008 to 2019 with groundwater modeling to study the drivers of observed freshwater lens dynamics. Electromagnetic induction (EMI) field data were collected on the main atoll islands over repeat transects in 2008 following ‘strong’ La Niña conditions (wet) and in 2016 during ‘very strong’ El Niño conditions (dry). Shallow monitoring wells were installed adjacent to the geophysical transects in 2013 and screened within the fresh/saline groundwater transition zone. Temporal EMI and monitoring well data showed a strong contraction of the freshwater lens in response to El Niño conditions, and indicated a thicker lens toward the ocean side, an opposite spatial pattern to that observed for many other Pacific islands. On an outer islet where a stand of mature Pisonia trees exist, EMI surveys revealed only a thin ({\textless}3 m from land surface) layer of brackish groundwater during El Niño. Numerical groundwater simulations were performed for a range of permeability distributions and climate conditions at Palmyra. Results revealed that the observed atypical lens asymmetry is likely due to more efficient submarine groundwater discharge on the lagoon side as a result of lagoon dredging and filling with high-permeability material.

We used acoustic telemetry to quantify the movement patterns of blacktip reef sharks (Carcharhinus melanopterus) at Palmyra Atoll National Wildlife Refuge, in the Pacific Ocean. Sharks had relatively small home ranges over a timescale of days to weeks (0.55 +/- 0.24 km2) and showed strong site fidelity to sand-flat ledges within the west lagoon over a three-year period. Sharks showed evidence of diel and tidal movements, and they utilized certain regions of the west lagoon disproportionately. There were ontogenetic shifts in habitat selection, with smaller sharks showing greater selection for sand-flat habitats, and pups (total length 35-61 cm) utilizing very shallow waters on sand-flats, potentially as nursery areas. Adult sharks selected ledge habitats and had lower rates of movement when over sand-flats and ledges than they did over lagoon waters. Fractal analysis of movements showed that over periods of days, sharks used patches that were 3-17\% of the scale of their home range. Repeat horizontal movements along ledge habitats consisted of relatively straight movements, which theoretical models consider the most efficient search strategy when forage patches may be spatially and temporally unpredictable. Although sharks moved using a direct walk while in patches, they appeared to move randomly between patches. Microhabitat quantity and quality had large effects on blacktip reef shark movements, which have consequences for the life-history characteristics of the species and potentially the spatial distribution of behaviorally mediated effects on lower trophic levels throughout the Palmyra ecosystem.},

Many major changes occurred between 1940 and 1945 when military construction created a dredged channel into the lagoon, enlarged several islands, joined most islands around the lagoon system into a continuous roadway, constructed a causeway separating two lagoons, and created several new islands. Overall, land area approximately doubled and land volume approximately trebled during this period, and the construction affected water circulation between reef flats and lagoons. Since 1945, the atoll has been largely uninhabited, construction and most maintenance of the newly-created shoreline has ceased, and coastlines of larger islands have simplified by infilling of bays and erosion of promontories, at net rates of up to 1.8 m/y. Narrower land masses have been broken into multiple smaller arcuate islands with intervening shallow channels. Sediment moves mainly westward along ocean coasts, into lagoons on lagoon coasts, and via tidal currents where causeways have been breached. In the east, Barren Island appeared and began growing from natural causes well before military construction. After purchase by The Nature Conservancy, the atoll was designated a U.S. National Wildlife Refuge in 2001. This protection offers the opportunity to observe coastal processes operating in the absence of the efforts to protect infrastructure typically associated with inhabited atolls.},

	abstract = {Human-induced environmental change has affected ecosystems on a global scale, altering the ecology and evolutionary trajectories of various species. Fishing of marine predators, and any cascading effects on marine ecosystems, is of critical concern. Predators are thought to be an important reason for why fish shoal; thus, reducing predator populations could alter shoaling behavior for prey fish, and impact aspects of their behavior or life-histories. Here, we explore differences in shoaling behavior of coral reef fishes at 2 islands whose predator populations face differing fishing intensities. We compared the tendency to shoal for 3 fish species between 2 Pacific coral reefs: Palmyra Atoll (USA), an unfished reef with high predator abundance, and Moorea (French Polynesia), a fished reef with low predator abundance. We also specifically characterize movement and foraging-associated behaviors of one of these fishes, the convict surgeonfish Acanthurus triostegus, in this same comparative context. Our work suggests that in areas with reduced predator abundance, the tendency of some, but not all, fish species to form shoals is reduced. Decreased predator abundance also appears to have affected movement of shoaling and solitary A. triostegus, with increases in distance travelled and area covered occurring in contexts with low predator abundance. These observations shed some empirical light on how overfishing could affect shoaling behavior. Such insight is specifically valuable in the context of coral reefs, where changes to low-trophic level fish movement and foraging (2 behaviors closely linked with shoaling) could affect the functioning of these vulnerable ecosystems.},

PFASs were maternally transferred to hawksbill eggs, with decreasing concentrations with distance from airports and with clutch order from one female. A risk assessment of PFOS showed concern for immunosuppression in Kailua green turtles and alarming concern for hawksbill developmental toxicity.

These boundary conditions consist of La Niña-like mean state conditions in the tropical Pacific with inter-annual and decadal variability about that altered state. The reconstructed SSTs in the tropical Pacific are used to force a 16 member ensemble of atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) simulations, coupled to a one layer ocean model outside of the tropical Pacific. The AGCM simulations of medieval climate are compared with modern climate simulations for the period 1856–2005 A.D. and are shown to reproduce many aspects of medieval hydroclimate found in paleo-proxy records for much of the Western Hemisphere, northern Eurasia, and the northern tropics. These results suggest that many features of global medieval hydroclimate changes can be explained by changes in tropical Pacific SSTs, though the potential role for other oceans is also discussed.},

The reciprocal monophyly of the mtDNA genealogies and the largely parapatric distribution of these lineages is consistent with reproductive isolation.

The fine-scale spatial patterning of herbivory has the potential to foster coral recruitment by creating a spatially continuous refuge for coral settlement and survival. The temporal nature of grazing also has the potential to influence competitive outcomes between coral and algae by preventing algal dominance and consistently exposing bare substrate at a particular location. Here we explore the intraspecific variability in the fine-scale feeding behavior of a large, mobile coral reef herbivore on a small, pristine Central Pacific atoll. We document how two different resource regimes appear to drive differences in the social structure and the spatial and temporal feeding behavior of the Steephead Parrotfish, Chlorurus microrhinos. We report that feeding behavior is spatially focused when resources are abundant and regrow quickly, resulting in dense patches of bite scars ({\textgreater}100 bites m-2). There also appears to be a temporal periodicity to feeding behavior when resource are abundant and predictable, although our study duration did not allow for the precise timing between feeding bouts to be detected. We found that movement increases and feeding behavior is distributed sparsely across food patches when resources were scarce and recovered more slowly. The differences we report here occur at sites that are only a few kilometers away from one another, but result in dramatically different impacts to the benthos that could alter the survival of corals at their earliest life stages.},

We investigated the importance of lagoons to the manta ray, Manta alfredi, a wide-ranging and vulnerable species in a less-disturbed atoll ecosystem. Lagoons are highly sensitive to anthropogenic disturbance and are known to be ecologically important to a wide variety of mobile species. We used a novel combination of research tools to examine the reliance of M. alfredi on lagoon habitats. Stable isotope analysis was used to assay the recent energetic importance of lagoons to M. alfredi; high-resolution tracking data provided information about how M. alfredi utilised lagoonal habitats over long and short time periods; acoustic cameras logged patterns of animal entrances and departures from lagoons; and photo identification/laser photogrammetry provided some insight into why they may be using this habitat. M. alfredi showed strong evidence of energetic dependence on lagoon resources during the course of the study and spent long periods of residence within lagoons or frequently transited into them from elsewhere. While within lagoons, they demonstrated affinities for particular structural features within this habitat and showed evidence of temporal patterning in habitat utilization. This work sheds light on how and why M. alfredi uses lagoons and raises questions about how this use may be altered in disturbed settings. More generally, these observations contribute to our knowledge of how to assess the ecological importance of particular habitats situated within the broader home range of mobile consumers.},

For sexually dimorphic species, we may expect resource partitioning by gender as well as by species identity. However, it is difficult to document species and sexual resource partitioning in marine ecosystems, given the intractability of these systems and the vagility of many marine animals. Here, we examined differences in the foraging behavior and prey selection of 2 congeneric and coexisting seabird species—masked boobies Sula dactylatra and red-footed boobies Sula sula—on Palmyra Atoll in the equatorial Pacific Ocean. These seabirds exhibit substantial size dimorphism between species and also have reverse sexual dimorphism within species. Pronounced interspecific differences in foraging patterns were observed with high-resolution GPS tracking devices, where smaller red-footed boobies conducted longer foraging trips (in both time and distance). Red-footed boobies also had more frequent landings on the sea surface, slower mean and maximum travel speeds, and more westerly trip azimuths. Stable isotope and diet analyses produced data that complemented returns from electronic tagging. Stable isotope ratios of carbon indicated that masked boobies foraged on prey with a less pelagic δ13C signature compared to red-footed boobies. In contrast, no gender differences were identified in any foraging parameters. The mechanisms for maintenance of these pronounced differences in niche partitioning across species were not explicitly examined, yet the data suggest physiological variation across species may be a more plausible mechanism than competitive interactions.},

Early efforts to reconstruct baselines resulted in the controversial suggestion that pristine coral reefs have inverted trophic pyramids, with disproportionally large top predator biomass. The validity of the coral reef inverted trophic pyramid has been questioned, but until now, was not resolved empirically. We use data from an eight-year tag-recapture program with spatially explicit, capture-recapture models to re-examine the population size and density of a key top predator at Palmyra atoll, the same location that inspired the idea of inverted trophic biomass pyramids in coral reef ecosystems. Given that animal movement is suspected to have significantly biased early biomass estimates of highly mobile top predators, we focused our reassessment on the most mobile and most abundant predator at Palmyra, the grey reef shark (Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos). We estimated a density of 21.3 (95\% CI 17.8, 24.7) grey reef sharks/km2, which is an order of magnitude lower than the estimates that suggested an inverted trophic pyramid. Our results indicate that the trophic structure of an unexploited reef fish community is not inverted, and that even healthy top predator populations may be considerably smaller, and more precarious, than previously thought.},

	abstract = {We compared parasite communities at two coral atolls in the Line Islands chain of the central Pacific (Kiritimati Island and Palmyra Atoll). Palmyra Atoll is relatively pristine while Kiritimati Island is heavily fished. At each island, we sampled five fish species for helminth and arthropod endoparasites: Chromis margaritifer, Plectroglyphidodon dickii,Paracirrhites arcatus, Acanthurus nigricans, and Lutjanus bohar. The surveys found monogeneans, digeneans, cestodes, nematodes, acanthocephalans, and copepods. Parasite richness was higher at Palmyra compared to Kiritimati for all five fish species. Fishes from Palmyra also tended to have more parasites species per host, higher parasite prevalence, and higher parasite abundance than did fishes from Kiritimati. The lower parasitism at Kiritimati may result from a simplified food web due to over fishing. Low biodiversity could impair parasite transmission by reducing the availability of hosts required by parasites with complex life cycles. Most notably, the lower abundances of larval shark tapeworms at Kiritimati presumably reflect the fact that fishing has greatly depleted sharks there in comparison to Palmyra.},

In 2011, black rats were successfully eradicated from Palmyra Atoll with a campaign built on lessons learned from a prior, unsuccessful ground-based eradiation attempt. The 2011 eradication team, at considerable cost and effort, ensured that bait (brodifacoum, 0.0025\%) was placed in every potential rat territory, including the atoll’s coconut palm canopy. Coconut palm is the dominant canopy tree at Palmyra, covering 45\% of the 235 ha land area. Bait applied to palm crowns is not available to land crabs and persists longer than bait placed on the ground. Rats were frequently observed traveling to and from the crowns of palms overhanging the water, yet this important habitat could not be treated by aerial broadcast (the primary bait application method) as this would place bait into the marine environment. To deliver bait to overhanging palms lining Palmyra’s shoreline, we developed a “bola” canopy bait (BCB) ‒ two cotton-gauze sacks connected by 20 cm of twine, each containing 12.5g of bait. A manufacturing system was created to produce the quantities of BCBs needed to treat Palmyra’s overhanging palm habitat. BCBs were slung by hand or with a sling-shot, or dropped into palm crowns by a team member suspended beneath a helicopter. Handheld GPS units were used to record the location of each palm crown treated with a BCB so that the bait application could be tracked. We believe that the successful outcome of the 2011 eradication was due, in part, to the comprehensive treatment of Palmyra’s palm canopy.},

	abstract = {Invasive rodent eradications are a proven, effective method of restoring affected ecosystems and preserving
biodiversity on islands. Current rodent eradication practices are inherited from successful temperate or subantarctic
campaigns, yet a direct translation of this practice to eradications on tropical islands can be problematic. Tropical island
rodent eradications face novel challenges not seen in temperate climates, such as land crabs and the use by rats of complex
three-dimensional habitats, such as the crowns of coconut palms (Cocos nucifera). To enhance the ability to anticipate
and respond to such challenges, we studied the role of land crabs in eradication outcomes, and patterns of habitat use
(ground vs. canopy) by rodents on several tropical islands. During rat eradication planning studies at Palmyra Atoll,
Line Islands, indigenous land crabs competed with ship rats (Rattus rattus) for broadcast bait pellets. At Dekehtik
Island, Pohnpei State, Federated States of Micronesia, rats (R. exulans) were frequently observed in the forest canopy
and most often in the crowns of coconut palms. A pyranine-based biomarker study conducted at Palmyra found that over
30\% of captured rats were not exposed to bait following sequential hand-broadcast applications of 18kg/ha and 9kg/ha.
Extensive use of coconut palm canopy habitat by rats and competition for bait with land crabs may reduce rat exposure
to rodenticide applied to the ground. The risk of land crab interference and canopy preference to eradication success can
be mitigated through increased broadcast application rates and aerial broadcast techniques. Such practices require close
scrutiny for potential adverse impacts to non-target species. A better understanding of the eradication challenges inherent
to tropical environments may enhance the conservation community’s ability to effectively and safely manage the threat
that invasive rodents present to tropical island biodiversity},

In the 1940s the Atoll underwent extensive military modifications, potentially making it susceptible to invasive species.

The Hawaiian Archipelago is the most likely source of the introductions via shipping or yachting activity to the Atoll. Currently, the impacts of these introductions remain unknown although future monitoring will assess the influence of these non-indigenous species on this remote reef system.},

Δ14C values rose from ∼−60‰ to ∼+110‰ by 1980 due to the input of bomb radiocarbon from the atmosphere. Elevated Δ14C values were observed for the mid- to late-1950s, suggesting early input of bomb radiocarbon, possibly from the largest Marshall Islands bomb tests in 1954. Secondary aragonite precipitation was identified in a portion of one core using scanning electron microscopy and X-radiography, and was responsible for high δ18O and δ13C values and a correlation between them. The Δ14C results were more resistant to alteration, except when contamination was from the bomb era ({\textgreater}1956).},

Working on a remote predator-dominated coral reef on Palmyra Atoll, USA, we used behavioral foraging observations to quantify the roles of common parrotfish and surgeonfish in the roving herbivore guild. We recorded species-specific bite rates on different benthic organisms, quantified the relative abundance of those benthic organisms, and estimated benthos-specific grazing intensities as a function of bite rates, fish abundance, and percent cover. These grazing metrics were compared between the exposed fore reef ({\textasciitilde}10 m depth) and protected reef terrace ({\textasciitilde}5 m depth) habitats. We observed large differences in feeding rates and substrate selectivity among fish species. Most species fed predominately on algal turfs; however, some species foraged broadly among fleshy macroalgal taxa, while others specialized on calcified green algae of the genus Halimeda. The highest bite rates were recorded from species targeting algal turfs, while the highest rates of defecation were recorded from species targeting Halimeda. Per capita bite rates of all species were higher in the fore reef habitat (mean 45\% more bites min-1); however, overall grazing intensities on turf algae (bites cm-2 d-1) were 5 times higher on the reef terrace than on the fore reef. Despite habitat-specific differences in the herbivore assemblages, the estimated distribution of total bites showed consistency among habitats, with strong guild-level positive foraging selectivity for algal turf. Comparisons of bite and defecation rate data for these herbivores across the Indo-Pacific highlight phylogenetic constraints on grazing activities. Overall, this study illustrates the importance of herbivore functional redundancy, variability in species-specific grazing, and provides a framework for assessing guild-wide grazing impacts on coral reefs.},

Colonial, reef-building corals present challenges to the study of demography, given that the size of individual colonies can be decoupled from age, and rates of colony growth and shrinkage can be effectively indeterminate. In this study, we use a large-area imaging approach to quantify demographic rates of the coral genus Pocillopora and test for the influence of colony-specific predictors on net change in live tissue area (labeled growth and shrinkage) and whole-colony mortality. We found that a colony’s fate was linked to its initial size, with larger colonies experiencing far lower probability of mortality, but higher probability of shrinkage, than smaller colonies. Historical effects also significantly affected colony fate, as colonies with a recent history of tissue loss experienced a higher probability of subsequent shrinkage and mortality the following year. Finally, significant variability in growth and mortality rates was linked to intra-island site differences, which we hypothesize may be driven by differences in food availability and heterotrophic feeding rates. Our work highlights the importance of colony-specific characteristics, including size and historical effects, in influencing demographic fates of corals.},

	abstract = {Native forests on islands throughout the global tropics face increasing pressure from the human-driven expansion of coconut palm (Cocos nucifera) planted for the purposes of coconut oil harvest. Conversion from native forests to Cocos monocultures leads to drastic ecological consequences in island environments and alters terrestrial and marine food webs through a variety of cascading effects and feedbacks. Despite the ecological significance and geographic range of Cocos expansion, large-scale assessments of coconut proliferation are still lacking due to the isolated nature of many islands where Cocos is found. Remote sensing approaches are often used to monitor forest composition at broad scales, but the small physical size of most islands limits the use of many popular satellite sensors with 15–30 m resolution. The recent availability of very high resolution ({\textless}5 m) satellite imagery facilitates novel assessment of this major ecological pattern, but the increased resolution introduces problematic ‘salt-and-pepper’ effects due to the heterogeneous nature of palm frond canopies. This case study evaluates the effectiveness of applying grey-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) textural features to very high resolution (0.5–2 m) WorldView-2 imagery to resolve the canopy heterogeneity problem and map the extent of Cocos spread on 21 islets of Palmyra Atoll, a protected United States National Wildlife Refuge in the Northern Line Islands. A random forest (RF)-driven classification scheme differentiating between coconut palms, native trees including Pisonia grandis, and endemic Scaevola sericea shrubs achieved 97.0\% overall accuracy and 98.4\% producer’s and user’s accuracies for the coconut palm class when trained on a combined spectral and GLCM textural feature set. Classifications restricted to the eight spectral bands of WorldView-2 are not only less accurate (89.4\% overall accuracy), but also significantly worse at identifying Cocos canopies (79.0\% versus 98.0\% accuracy when GLCM textures are included). However, paring down the full set of sixteen spectral and textural features to the three most important of each type did not result in significant changes in accuracy. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of a joint high-resolution textural and spectral approach for remotely quantifying the spread of Cocos and its impacts on native tree communities throughout the tropics, including remote island locations.},

	abstract = {Coral reef ecosystems are exposed to a range of environmental forcings that vary on daily to decadal time scales and across spatial scales spanning from reefs to archipelagos. Environmental variability is a major determinant of reef ecosystem structure and function, including coral reef extent and growth rates, and the abundance, diversity, and morphology of reef organisms. Proper characterization of environmental forcings on coral reef ecosystems is critical if we are to understand the dynamics and implications of abiotic–biotic interactions on reef ecosystems. This study combines high-resolution bathymetric information with remotely sensed sea surface temperature, chlorophyll-a and irradiance data, and modeled wave data to quantify environmental forcings on coral reefs. We present a methodological approach to develop spatially constrained, island- and atoll-scale metrics that quantify climatological range limits and anomalous environmental forcings across U.S. Pacific coral reef ecosystems. Our results indicate considerable spatial heterogeneity in climatological ranges and anomalies across 41 islands and atolls, with emergent spatial patterns specific to each environmental forcing. For example, wave energy was greatest at northern latitudes and generally decreased with latitude. In contrast, chlorophyll-a was greatest at reef ecosystems proximate to the equator and northern-most locations, showing little synchrony with latitude. In addition, we find that the reef ecosystems with the highest chlorophyll-a concentrations; Jarvis, Howland, Baker, Palmyra and Kingman are each uninhabited and are characterized by high hard coral cover and large numbers of predatory fishes. Finally, we find that scaling environmental data to the spatial footprint of individual islands and atolls is more likely to capture local environmental forcings, as chlorophyll-a concentrations decreased at relatively short distances ({\textgreater}7 km) from 85\% of our study locations. These metrics will help identify reef ecosystems most exposed to environmental stress as well as systems that may be more resistant or resilient to future climate change.},

Despite these riches, the atoll’s ecosystem has been modified by introduced black rats that were inadvertently brought to Palmyra during WWII. Between June 1 and 30, 2011, a partnership between the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, The Nature Conservancy, and Island Conservation successfully implemented a project to remove rats from Palmyra. Independent monitoring of bait application and its environmental effects was undertaken by the USDA. Over the 28-day operation, a team of 41 people from 5 countries utilized 2 helicopters, 10 slingshots, 148 bait stations, and hand spreading to strategically apply 38,561 kg of rodent bait containing the anticoagulant brodifacoum (25 ppm) to Palmyra’s 235 hectares of emergent land. Palmyra’s challenging eradication environment demanded the development of a novel approach, such as broadcast application rates between 75 and 85 kg/ha and the use of “bolas” to bait coastal forest canopy to minimize bait drift into the marine environment. Initial findings show minimal non-target impacts as a result of the project, and post-eradication monitoring has failed to detect rats. Increased recruitment by at least 2 native tree species has been observed. By removing rats from Palmyra, the partnership aims to safeguard the atoll’s indigenous flora and fauna, encourage the reestablishment of extirpated seabird species, and create an ecological refuge for species within the Central Pacific region that are at risk of extinction. This project is a conservation milestone for the Refuge, and it has established a benchmark for eradication campaigns on other tropical islands.},

	abstract = {Competition for fresh water between native and introduced plants is one important challenge facing native forests as rainfall variability increases. Competition can be especially acute for vegetation on Pacific atolls, which depend upon consistent rainfall to replenish shallow groundwater stores. Patterns of sap flow, water use, and diameter growth of Pisonia grandis trees were investigated on Sand Islet, Palmyra Atoll, Line Islands, during a period of low rainfall. Sap flow in the outer sapwood was reduced by 53\% for P. grandis trees growing within coconut palm (Cocos nucifera) stands (n = 9) versus away from coconut palm (n = 9). This suggested that water uptake was being limited by coconut palm. Radial patterns of sap flow into the sapwood of P. grandis also differed between stands with and without coconut palm, such that individual tree water use for P. grandis ranged from 14 to 67 L day−1, averaging 47·8 L day−1 without coconut palm and 23·6 L day−1 with coconut palm. Diameter growth of P. grandis was measured from nine islets. In contrast to sap flow, competition with coconut palm increased diameter growth by 89\%, equating to an individual tree basal area increment of 5·4 versus 10·3 mm2 day−1. Greater diameter growth countered by lower rates of water use by P. grandis trees growing in competition with coconut palm suggests that stem swell may be associated with water storage when positioned in the understory of coconut palm, and may facilitate survival when water becomes limiting until too much shading overwhelms P. grandis.

	abstract = {A management proposal aims to partly remove a WWII military causeway at Palmyra Atoll to improve lagoon water circulation and alleviate sedimentation stress on the southeast backreef, an area of high coral cover and diversity. This action could result in a shift in sedimentation across reef sites. To provide management advice, we quantified the proximate environmental factors driving scleractinian coral cover and community patterns at Palmyra. The proportion of fine sedimentation was the optimal predictor of coral cover and changes in community structure, explaining 23.7\% and 24.7\% of the variation between sites, respectively. Scleractinian coral cover was negatively correlated with increases in fine sedimentation. Removing the causeway could negatively affect the Montipora corals that dominate the western reef terrace, as this genus was negatively correlated with levels of fine sedimentation. The tolerance limits of corals, and sediment re-distribution patterns, should be determined prior to complete removal of the causeway.},

	abstract = {Diseases often display complex and distinct associations with their environment due to differences in etiology, modes of transmission between hosts, and the shifting balance between pathogen virulence and host resistance. Statistical modeling has been underutilized in coral disease research to explore the spatial patterns that result from this triad of interactions. We tested the hypotheses that: 1) coral diseases show distinct associations with multiple environmental factors, 2) incorporating interactions (synergistic collinearities) among environmental variables is important when predicting coral disease spatial patterns, and 3) modeling overall coral disease prevalence (the prevalence of multiple diseases as a single proportion value) will increase predictive error relative to modeling the same diseases independently. Four coral diseases: Porites growth anomalies (PorGA), Porites tissue loss (PorTL), Porites trematodiasis (PorTrem), and Montipora white syndrome (MWS), and their interactions with 17 predictor variables were modeled using boosted regression trees (BRT) within a reef system in Hawaii. Each disease showed distinct associations with the predictors. Environmental predictors showing the strongest overall associations with the coral diseases were both biotic and abiotic. PorGA was optimally predicted by a negative association with turbidity, PorTL and MWS by declines in butterflyfish and juvenile parrotfish abundance respectively, and PorTrem by a modal relationship with Porites host cover. Incorporating interactions among predictor variables contributed to the predictive power of our models, particularly for PorTrem. Combining diseases (using overall disease prevalence as the model response), led to an average six-fold increase in cross-validation predictive deviance over modeling the diseases individually. We therefore recommend coral diseases to be modeled separately, unless known to have etiologies that respond in a similar manner to particular environmental conditions. Predictive statistical modeling can help to increase our understanding of coral disease ecology worldwide.},

Genetic analysis assigned natal origins almost exclusively (approx. 97\%) to the West Central and South Central Pacific combined Regional Management Units. Further, our modelling results indicated that turtles could potentially drift from rookeries to Palmyra Atoll via surface currents along a near-Equatorial swathe traversing the Pacific. Comparing findings from genetics and modelling highlighted the complex impacts of ocean currents and behaviour on natal origins. Although the Palmyra feeding ground was highly differentiated genetically from others in the Indo-Pacific, there was no significant differentiation among years, sexes or stage-classes at the Refuge. Understanding the distribution of this foraging population advances knowledge of green turtles and contributes to effective conservation planning for this threatened species.},

However, observations of apparent predator–prey interactions between the piscivorous twinspot snapper Lutjanus bohar and the herbivorous surgeonfish Acanthurus triostegus suggest that the nature of their association may be context-dependent. The context-dependent nature of some species interactions is well-known, and in some cases a single species has been shown to act as both predator and facilitator to its prey. We present incidental in situ observations suggesting that, in the context of voraciously grazing schools of A. triostegus, this species pair may also engage in a facultative mutualistic relationship. Specifically, we propose that within this context, both species may indirectly derive a benefit through changes in the behavior and/or density of territorial damselfishes driven by both L. bohar and A. triostegus. We provide prescriptions for rigorously testing this hypothesis and suggest that re-evaluation of this, and possibly other, ostensibly exclusive predator–prey pairs in marine systems may reveal unexpected relationships. Given the relative lack of examples of such interactions involving the same predator acting as both facilitator and predator from marine versus terrestrial systems, coupled with this preliminary evidence, we propose that this topic is ripe for exploration.},

	abstract = {In recent years, it has become apparent that human impacts have altered community structure in coastal and marine ecosystems worldwide. Of these, fishing is one of the most pervasive, and a growing body of work suggests that fishing can have strong effects on the ecology of target species, especially top predators. However, the effects of removing top predators on lower trophic groups of prey fishes are less clear, particularly in highly diverse and trophically complex coral reef ecosystems. We examined patterns of abundance, size structure, and age-based demography through surveys and collection-based studies of five fish species from a variety of trophic levels at Kiritimati and Palmyra, two nearby atolls in the Northern Line Islands. These islands have similar biogeography and oceanography, and yet Kiritimati has ∼10,000 people with extensive local fishing while Palmyra is a US National Wildlife Refuge with no permanent human population, no fishing, and an intact predator fauna. Surveys indicated that top predators were relatively larger and more abundant at unfished Palmyra, while prey functional groups were relatively smaller but showed no clear trends in abundance as would be expected from classic trophic cascades. Through detailed analyses of focal species, we found that size and longevity of a top predator were lower at fished Kiritimati than at unfished Palmyra. Demographic patterns also shifted dramatically for 4 of 5 fish species in lower trophic groups, opposite in direction to the top predator, including decreases in average size and longevity at Palmyra relative to Kiritimati. Overall, these results suggest that fishing may alter community structure in complex and non-intuitive ways, and that indirect demographic effects should be considered more broadly in ecosystem-based management.},

	abstract = {Predator-prey interactions shape ecosystems and can help maintain biodiversity. However, for many of the earth's most biodiverse and abundant organisms, including terrestrial arthropods, these interactions are difficult or impossible to observe directly with traditional approaches. Based on previous theory, it is likely that predator-prey interactions for these organisms are shaped by a combination of predator traits, including body size and species-specific hunting strategies. In this study, we combined diet DNA metabarcoding data of 173 individual invertebrate predators from nine species (a total of 305 individual predator-prey interactions) with an extensive community body size data set of a well-described invertebrate community to explore how predator traits and identity shape interactions. We found that (1) mean size of prey families in the field usually scaled with predator size, with species-specific variation to a general size-scaling relationship (exceptions likely indicating scavenging or feeding on smaller life stages). We also found that (2) although predator hunting traits, including web and venom use, are thought to shape predator-prey interaction outcomes, predator identity more strongly influenced our indirect measure of the relative size of predators and prey (predator:prey size ratios) than either of these hunting traits. Our findings indicate that predator body size and species identity are important in shaping trophic interactions in invertebrate food webs and could help predict how anthropogenic biodiversity change will influence terrestrial invertebrates, the earth's most diverse animal taxonomic group.},

On coral reefs, the consequences of varied space use by herbivores on benthic community structure are not well understood, nor are the relative influences of bottom-up (resource abundance and quality), horizontal (competition), and top-down (predation risk) factors in affecting spatial foraging behaviors of mobile herbivorous fishes. In the current study we quantified space use and feeding rates of the parrotfish, Chlorurus spilurus, across a strong gradient of food resources and predator and competitor abundance across two islands with drastically different fisheries management schemes. We found evidence that while feeding rates of this species are affected by direct interference competition and chronic predation risk, space use appears to be primarily related to exploitative competition with the surrounding herbivore community. We found no evidence that predation risk influences diurnal foraging space use in this small bodied parrotfish species. Additionally, we found the influence of chronic predation risk on feeding rates of this species to be less dramatic than the results of recent studies that used model predators to measure acute behavioral responses of other species of herbivorous fishes. Our results indicate that the non-consumptive effects of predators on the foraging behaviors of coral reef herbivores may be less dramatic than previously thought.},

However, tracking early life stage individuals through time in natural settings is difficult, limiting our understanding of the duration of these ‘mortality bottlenecks’, and the time required for survivorship to match that of adults. Here, we track a cohort of juvenile corals (1–5 cm maximum diameter) from 12 taxa at a remote atoll in the Central Pacific from 2013 to 2017 and describe patterns of annual survivorship. Of the 537 juveniles initially detected, 219 (41\%) were alive 4 years later, 163 (30\%) died via complete loss of live tissue from the skeleton, and the remaining 155 (29\%) died via dislodgement. The differing mortality patterns suggest that habitat characteristics, as well as species-specific features, may influence early life stage survival. Across most taxa, survival fit a logistic model, reaching {\textgreater} 90\% annual survival within 4 years. These data suggest that mortality bottlenecks characteristic of ‘recruitment’ extend up to 5 years after individuals can be visually detected. Ultimately, replenishment of adult coral populations via sexual reproduction is needed to maintain both coral cover and genetic diversity. This study provides key insights into the dynamics and time scales that characterize these critical early life stages.},

	abstract = {Primary producers in terrestrial and marine systems can be affected by fungal pathogens threatening the provision of critical ecosystem services. Crustose coralline algae (CCA) are ecologically important members of tropical reef systems and are impacted by coralline fungal disease (CFD) which manifests as overgrowth of the CCA crust by fungal lesions causing partial to complete mortality of the CCA host. No natural controls for CFD have been identified, but nominally herbivorous fish could play a role by consuming pathogenic fungi. We documented preferential grazing on fungal lesions by adults of six common reef-dwelling species of herbivorous Acanthuridae and Labridae, (surgeonfish and parrotfish) which collectively demonstrated an {\textasciitilde} 80-fold higher grazing rate on fungal lesions relative to their proportionate benthic coverage, and a preference for lesions over other palatable substrata (e.g. live scleractinian coral, CCA, or algae). Furthermore, we recorded a {\textasciitilde} 600\% increase in live CFD lesion size over an approximately 2-week period when grazing by herbivorous fish was experimentally excluded suggesting that herbivorous reef fish could control CFD progression by directly reducing biomass of the fungal pathogen. Removal rates may be sufficient to allow CCA to recover from infection and explain historically observed natural waning behaviour after an outbreak. Thus, in addition to their well-known role as determinants of macroalgal overgrowth of reefs, herbivorous fish could thus also be important in control of diseases affecting crustose coralline algae that stabilize the foundation of coral reef substrata.},

Understanding how corals have adapted to distinct oceanographic regimes on multiple scales can provide insight into future tolerance and persistence, information critical to directed intervention or targeted protections. The northern Line Islands span a gradient in oceanographic regimes across latitudes, with seawater becoming warmer, fresher, more oligotrophic, and more saturated with aragonite away from the equator. The combination of this regional gradient and island-scale (local) conditions was used as a natural experiment against which to test how massive Porites corals respond to these background conditions and episodic heat stress. We found that coral condition, represented by a metric combining tissue thickness, lipids, and calcification, was similar at almost all islands, though there were differences in how corals allocate resources among these biological parameters. Corals at Teraina, the most densely inhabited island, showed evidence for reduced calcification, potentially associated with human impacts and/or outflow of freshwater from the island. In contrast, Porites corals at Palmyra, a wildlife reserve, exhibited unexpectedly high tissue-condition metrics for its latitude, suggesting an additional food source, possibly plankton-rich lagoonal outflow. We did not find a strong relationship between human habitation and the response of Porites corals to recent heat stress. However, differences in coral calcification rates and energy stores between observed values and those expected based solely on the regional oceanographic gradient, suggests local effects have indirect impacts on these corals.},

It has been proposed that their presence is necessary for positively shaping the structure and functioning of ecosystems. We evaluated this hypothesis using the case of the world's largest parrotfish (Bolbometopon muricatum), a globally imperiled species. We used direct observation, animal tracking, and computer simulations to examine the diverse routes through which B. muricatum affects the diversity, dispersal, relative abundance, and survival of the corals that comprise the foundation of reef ecosystems. Our results suggest that this species can influence reef building corals in both positive and negative ways. Field observation and simulation outputs indicated that B. muricatum reduced the abundance of macroalgae that can outcompete corals, but they also feed directly on corals, decreasing coral abundance, diversity, and colony size. B. muricatum appeared to facilitate coral advancement by mechanically dispersing coral fragments and opening up bare space for coral settlement, but they also damaged adult corals and remobilized a large volume of potentially stressful carbonate sediment. The impacts this species has on reefs appears to be regulated in part by its abundance—the effects of B. muricatum were more intense in simulation scenarios populated with high densities of these fish. Observations conducted in regions with high and low predator (e.g., sharks) abundance generated results that are consistent with the hypothesis that these predators of B. muricatum may play a role in governing their abundance; thus, predation may modulate the intensity of the effects they have on reef dynamics. Overall our results illustrate that functionally unique and threatened species may not have universally positive impacts on ecosystems and that it may be necessary for environmental managers to consider the diverse effects of such species and the forces that mediate the strength of their influence.

	abstract = {Background The demography of a coral colony is not a binary trajectory of life and death. Based on the flexibility afforded by colonial organization, most reef-building corals employ a variety of dynamic survival strategies, including growth and shrinkage. The demographic flexibility affects coral size, shape and reproductive output, among other factors. It is thus critical to quantify the relative importance of key dynamics of recruitment, mortality, growth and shrinkage in changing the overall cover of coral on a reef. Methods Using fixed photographic quadrats, we tracked the patterns of change in the cover of one common central Pacific coral, Porites superfusa, before and after the 2009 ENSO event. Results Coral colonies suffered both whole and partial colony mortality, although larger colonies were more likely to survive. In subsequent years, recruitment of new colonies and regrowth of surviving colonies both contributed to the modest recovery of P. superfusa. Discussion This study is unique in its quantitative comparisons of coral recruitment versus regrowth during periods of areal expansion. Our data suggest that recovery is not limited simply to the long pathway of settlement, recruitment and early growth of new colonies but is accelerated by means of regrowth of already established colonies having suffered partial mortality.},

Though broadly distributed throughout the world's oceans, bottlenose dolphins are known to form small populations in coastal waters.

Inclusion in our analyses of samples collected near Palmyra Atoll provided evidence that the Hawaiian Islands are also occasionally visited by members of a genetically distinct, pelagic population. Two of our samples exhibited evidence of partial ancestry from Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (T. aduncus), a species not known to inhabit the Hawaiian Archipelago.

	title = {Physical oceanography in coral reef environments: wave and mean flow dynamics at small and large scales, and resulting ecological implications},
	url = {https://purl.stanford.edu/fj342cd7577},
	abstract = {This dissertation investigates the physical oceanography of coral reef environments, specifically focusing on waves and mean flows at small and large scales. At small scales of order ten to a hundred meters, the role of spur and groove formations and their interaction with surface waves and mean flow is examined. Spur-and-groove formations are found on the fore reefs of many coral reefs worldwide. Although these formations are primarily present in wave-dominated environments, their effect on wave-driven hydrodynamics is not well understood. A two-dimensional, depth-averaged, phase-resolving non-linear Boussinesq model (funwaveC) was used to model hydrodynamics on a simplified spur-and-groove system. The modeling results show that the spur-and-groove formations together with shoaling waves induce a nearshore Lagrangian circulation pattern of counter-rotating circulation cells. We present results from two separate field studies of SAG formations on Palmyra Atoll which show their effect on waves to be small, but reveal a persistent order 1 cm/s depth-averaged Lagrangian offshore flow over the spur and onshore flow over the grooves. This circulation was stronger for larger, directly-incident waves and low alongshore flow conditions, consistent with predictions from modeling. Vertical flow was downward over the spur and upward over the groove, likely driven by alongshore differences in bottom stress and not by vortex forcing. We suggest that the conditions for coral recruitment and growth appear to be more favorable on the spur than the groove due to (1) higher "food" supply from higher mean alongshore velocity, downward vertical velocity, and higher turbulence, and (2) lower sediment accumulation due to higher and more variable bottom shear stress. At large scales of order hundreds of meters to kilometers, the wave and mean flow dynamics of a pacific atoll are investigated. We report field measurements of waves and currents made from Sept-2011 to Jul-2014 on Palmyra Atoll in the Central Pacific that were used in conjunction with a coupled wave and three-dimensional hydrodynamic model (COAWST) to characterize the waves and hydrodynamics operant on the atoll. Bottom friction, modeled with a modified bottom roughness formulation, is the significant source of wave energy dissipation on the atoll, a result that is consistent with available observations of wave damping on Palmyra. Indeed observed and modeled dissipation rates are an order of magnitude larger than what has been observed on other, less geometrically complex reefs. At the scale of the atoll itself, strong regional flows create flow separation and a well-defined wake, similar to the classic fluid mechanics problem of flow past a cylinder. Circulation within the atoll is primarily governed by tides and waves, and secondarily by wind and regional currents. Tidally driven flow is important at all field sites, and the tidal phasing experiences significant delay with travel into the interior lagoons. Wave driven flow is significant at most of the field sites, and is a strong function of the dominant wave direction. Wind driven flow is generally weak, except on the shallow terraces. The near bed squared wave velocity, a proxy for bottom stress, shows strong spatial variability across the atoll and exerts control over geomorphic structure and high coral cover. Based on Lagrangian float tracks, the mean age was the best predictor of geomorphic structure and appears to clearly differentiate the geomorphic structures. While high mean flow appears to differentiate very productive coral regions, low water age and low temperature appear to be the most important variables for distinguishing between biological cover types at this site. The sites with high coral cover can have high diurnal temperature variability, but their average weekly temperature variability is similar to offshore waters. The mechanism for maintaining this low mean temperature is high mean advection, which occurs at timescales of a week, and is primarily governed by wave driven flows. The resulting connectivity within the atoll system shows that the general trends follow the mean flow paths; however, some connectivity exists between all regions of the atoll system.},

	abstract = {Due to rapidly changing global environmental conditions, many animals are now experiencing concurrent changes in both resource availability and the foraging cues associated with finding those resources. By employing flexible, plastic foraging strategies that use different types of environmental foraging cues, animals could adapt to these novel future environments. To evaluate the extent to which such flexibility and plasticity exist, we analyzed a large dataset of a clade (Sulidae; the boobies) of widespread aerial tropical predators that feed in highly variable marine habitats. These surface foragers are typical of many ocean predators that face dynamic and patchy foraging environments and use a combination of static and ephemeral oceanographic features to locate prey. We compared foraging habitats and behaviors of four species at seven colonies in the eastern and central Pacific Ocean that varied greatly in depth, topography, and primary productivity. Foraging behaviors, recorded by GPS-tracking tags, were compared to remotely sensed environmental features, to characterize habitat-behavior interactions. K-means clustering grouped environmental characteristics into five habitat clusters across the seven sites. We found that boobies relied on a combination of static and ephemeral cues, especially depth, chlorophyll-a concentrations, and sea surface height (ocean surface topography). Notably, foraging behaviors were strongly predicted by local oceanographic habitats across species and sites, suggesting a high degree of behavioral plasticity in use of different foraging cues. Flexibility allows these top predators to adapt to, and exploit, static and ephemeral oceanic features. Plasticity may well facilitate these species, and other similarly dynamic foragers, to cope with increasingly changing environmental conditions.},

	abstract = {Plant introductions and subsequent community shifts are known to affect nutrient cycling, but most such studies have focused on nutrient enrichment effects. The nature of plant-driven nutrient depletions and the mechanisms by which these might occur are relatively poorly understood. In this study we demonstrate that the proliferation of the commonly introduced coconut palm, Cocos nucifera, interrupts the flow of allochthonous marine subsidies to terrestrial ecosystems via an indirect effect: impact on birds. Birds avoid nesting or roosting in C. nucifera, thus reducing the critical nutrient inputs they bring from the marine environment. These decreases in marine subsidies then lead to reductions in available soil nutrients, decreases in leaf nutrient quality, diminished leaf palatability, and reduced herbivory. This nutrient depletion pathway contrasts the more typical patterns of nutrient enrichment that follow plant species introductions. Research on the effects of spatial subsidy disruptions on ecosystems has not yet examined interruptions driven by changes within the recipient community, such as plant community shifts. The ubiquity of coconut palm introductions across the tropics and subtropics makes these observations particularly noteworthy. Equally important, the case of C. nucifera provides a strong demonstration of how plant community changes can dramatically impact the supply of allochthonous nutrients and thereby reshape energy flow in ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Coral reefs can undergo relatively rapid changes in the dominant biota, a phenomenon referred to as phase shift. Various reasons have been proposed to explain this phenomenon including increased human disturbance, pollution, or changes in coral reef biota that serve a major ecological function such as depletion of grazers. However, pinpointing the actual factors potentially responsible can be problematic. Here we show a phase shift from coral to the corallimorpharian Rhodactis howesii associated with a long line vessel that wrecked in 1991 on an isolated atoll (Palmyra) in the central Pacific Ocean. We documented high densities of R. howesii near the ship that progressively decreased with distance from the ship whereas R. howesii were rare to absent in other parts of the atoll. We also confirmed high densities of R. howesii around several buoys recently installed on the atoll in 2001. This is the first time that a phase shift on a coral reef has been unambiguously associated with man-made structures. This association was made, in part, because of the remoteness of Palmyra and its recent history of minimal human habitation or impact. Phase shifts can have long-term negative ramification for coral reefs, and eradication of organisms responsible for phase shifts in marine ecosystems can be difficult, particularly if such organisms cover a large area. The extensive R. howesii invasion and subsequent loss of coral reef habitat at Palmyra also highlights the importance of rapid removal of shipwrecks on corals reefs to mitigate the potential of reef overgrowth by invasives.},

	abstract = {Many corals live in marginal habitats, close to their survival thresholds of water temperature, light penetration and aragonite saturation. Living under these highly variable and extreme conditions is likely facilitated by specific physiological adaptations and/or the presence of unique species of coral and their symbionts but 
data on these factors are limited. The specific objectives of the study were to: (1) examine the diversity and distribution patterns of corals in marginal environments, (2) investigate the diversity, distribution patterns and host specificity of symbionts in corals in marginal 
environments, (3) assess the influence of environmental variables on host and symbiont distribution in marginal environments, in comparison to 'optimal' environments, and (4) examine the physiological responses to changing 
environmental conditions and stress of corals and their symbionts in marginal environments. Surveys of coral community patterns were conducted at the Kermadec Islands (KI), New Zealand, and Palmyra Atoll, USA, with local scale environmental parameters (i.e. wave exposure and sedimentation) found to control the diversity and distribution of the coral communities. Symbiodinium types were identified to subcladal 
level in a range of coral species at each of the survey sites, using ITS2-DGGE. A high diversity of C type symbionts (19 types in 13 host genera), and reduced host specificity was observed at the high latitude site of Lord Howe Island (LHI), 
Australia, with similarly high diversity at the KI (10 types in 9 genera). Thirteen novel clade C types were identified in corals at LHI, with two of these types also present in hosts at the KI. The reduced host specificity of symbionts at LHI, compared to tropical sites, implies that the evolution of novel holobionts may be an important mechanism whereby corals can cope with variable and stressful conditions. Further, physiological assessment of the novel LHI symbionts led to the suggestion that Symbiodinium at LHI may be specialised for cooler and more variable 
temperatures, so contributing to the success of corals at this marginal location. In contrast, a low diversity of generalist symbionts (C and D types) were uncovered at the equatorial site of Palmyra Atoll (10 types in 13 genera), attributed to the stressful environmental regime resulting in a reduced population of stresstolerant symbionts. The variation in environmental parameters, particularly sedimentation, around Palmyra Atoll has led to diversification of coral communities, 
however this environmental variation has not affected the symbiont communities. While it has been suggested that marginal coral communities might be better adapted for survival in an environment modified by global climate change, the local scale environmental factors are also important drivers of both coral and symbiont 
distributions, and should be considered when making predictions for the future. Further, assessment of the physiological tolerance ranges of both the multiple, novel symbionts at high latitudes, and the few, potentially stress-tolerant symbionts at Palmyra should be conducted, to help determine whether they have the ability to 
adjust to new environmental conditions.},

Also of great interest are the fine-scale foraging patterns of parrotfishes and the spatial and temporal scale of their interactions with benthic organisms. In this study, we performed a comprehensive evaluation of the movement patterns of the parrotfish Chlorurus microrhinos at multiple spatial and temporal scales at Palmyra Atoll in 2013-2015. We found that these fish have large home ranges when accounting for migrations to spawning and night refuge sites, but that within feeding territories, their activity is highly non-random and is quite spatially constrained and temporally episodic, indicating a high level of feeding selectivity. These patterns of foraging activity result in the patchy removal of algae from the reef, which may have consequences for the space competition between algae and corals.},

In the oligotrophic central Pacific, a patchy and dynamic ecosystem, a robust network of PMPAs has recently been established. However, evaluations of PMPA efficacy in providing appropriate habitat coverage for pelagic species are lacking, particularly in the tropics. Here, we used high resolution GPS tracking and home range analyses of tropical boobies to determine the distribution and foraging habitat use of three sympatric species (Sula sula, Sula dactylatra, and Sula leucogaster) in two PMPAs that varied substantially in size and shape. At each site we characterized the extent and use of foraging habitat inside and outside the PMPA that surrounded each breeding colony. We found profound variation within and among species in foraging behavior and habitat use across the two sites; this was partially explained by variation in bathymetry. Yet, despite variation both in PMPA size and shape, and in foraging behavior of the birds, we determined that the PMPAs each encapsulated more than 85\% (n=216 trips) of foraging habitat for each species, indicating that these PMPAs provided important habitat coverage for highly mobile tropical species. While this study highlights the challenges in effectively designing PMPAs even for relatively well-studied, central place foragers, given strong variation in foraging ecologies across sites, it also suggests that PMPAs do provide meaningful habitat coverage for at least some pelagic species.},

The aim of this study was to examine the consistency of relationships between sponge abundance and richness on the undersides of boulders (to control for multiple confounding factors) in relation to space availability (boulder size) in three widely separated biogeographic regions. Sponges followed typical species-area (SA) relationships irrespective of site or ocean and we consistently found no decrease in sponge richness at larger boulder sizes. We also found reliable underlying density–area (DA) relationships, with larger boulders supporting more sponge patches at all sites. Although the general SA and DA relationships were similar between oceans and sites, the exact nature of these relationships in terms of the actual species present per unit area, total number of species present or density differed between sites. There were no consistent differences between SA and DA relationships at each locality, suggesting that although disturbance (particularly wave action) regimes may play an important role in controlling sponge biodiversity and abundance, its effects are manifested differently at local-scales. Even though boulders have received a considerable amount of research effort over the past three decades, this is the first study to examine the consistency of DA and SA relationships between ocean basins, finding similar relationships.},

	abstract = {In Hawaii, coral reefs occur across a gradient of biological (host abundance), climatic (sea surface temperature anomalies) and anthropogenic conditions from the human-impacted reefs of the main Hawaiian Islands (MHI) to the pristine reefs of the northwestern Hawaiian Islands (NWHI). Coral disease surveys were conducted at 142 sites from across the Archipelago and disease patterns examined. Twelve diseases were recorded from three coral genera (Porites, Montipora, Acropora) with Porites having the highest prevalence. Porites growth anomalies (PorGAs) were significantly more prevalent within and indicative of reefs in the MHI and Porites trematodiasis (PorTrm) was significantly more prevalent within and indicative of reefs in the NWHI. Porites tissue loss syndrome (PorTLS) was also important in driving regional differences but that relationship was less clear. These results highlight the importance of understanding disease ecology when interpreting patterns of disease occurrence. PorTrm is caused by a parasitic flatworm that utilizes multiple hosts during its life cycle (fish, mollusk and coral). All three hosts must be present for the disease to occur and higher host abundance leads to higher disease prevalence. Thus, a high prevalence of PorTrm on Hawaiian reefs would be an indicator of a healthy coral reef ecosystem. In contrast, the high occurrence of PorGAs within the MHI suggests that PorGAs are related, directly or indirectly, to some environmental co-factor associated with increased human population sizes. Focusing on the three indicator diseases (PorGAs, PorTrm, PorTLS) we used statistical modeling to examine the underlying associations between disease prevalence and 14 different predictor variables (biotic and abiotic). All three diseases showed positive associations with host abundance and negative associations with thermal stress. The association with human population density differed among disease states with PorGAs showing a positive and PorTrm showing a negative association, but no significant explanatory power was offered for PorTLS.},

When host densities are high enough, parasites can regulate or even decimate their populations, causing regime shifts in marine systems. As consumers and resources, parasites are enmeshed in food webs in ways that are different from free-living species. Their unique lifestyle renders parasites more susceptible to perturbations than their free-living hosts. As a result, parasites serve as useful indicators of ecosystem integrity. A theory for how food webs affect parasites will help us better understand why a particular infectious disease has become problematic, give insight into how restoration might reduce a costly marine disease, or let us use parasites as indicators to follow changes in food-web complexity.},

NMR-guided fractionation in combination with MS2-based molecular networking and isolation via HPLC yielded 0.7 mg of the pure compound. The small quantity isolated along with the presence of significant signal degeneracy in both the 1H and 13C-NMR spectra complicated the structure elucidation of palstimolide A. Various NMR experiments and solvent systems were employed, including the LR-HSQMBC experiment that allows the detection of long-range 1H–13C correlation data across 4-, 5-, and even 6-bonds. This expanded NMR data set enabled the elucidation of the palstimolide’s planar structure, which is characterized by several 1,5-disposed hydroxy groups as well as a tert-butyl group. The compound showed potent antimalarial activity with an IC50 of 223 nM as well as interesting anti-leishmanial activity with an IC50 of 4.67 µM.},

We currently lack an understanding of how climate change stressors, such as ocean acidification (OA) and warming, may simultaneously affect coral reef disease dynamics, particularly diseases threatening key reef-building organisms, for example crustose coralline algae (CCA). Here, we use coralline fungal disease (CFD), a previously described CCA disease from the Pacific, to examine these simultaneous effects using both field observations and experimental manipulations. We identify the associated fungus as belonging to the subphylum Ustilaginomycetes and show linear lesion expansion rates on individual hosts can reach 6.5 mm per day. Further, we demonstrate for the first time, to our knowledge, that ocean-warming events could increase the frequency of CFD outbreaks on coral reefs, but that OA-induced lowering of pH may ameliorate outbreaks by slowing lesion expansion rates on individual hosts. Lowered pH may still reduce overall host survivorship, however, by reducing calcification and facilitating fungal bio-erosion. Such complex, interactive effects between simultaneous extrinsic environmental stressors on disease dynamics are important to consider if we are to accurately predict the response of coral reef communities to future climate change.},

In a cooperative effort, we monitored the application of a rodenticide, ‘Brodifacoum 25W: Conservation’, during an attempt to eradicate Rattus rattus from Palmyra Atoll. In 2011, Brodifacoum 25W: Conservation was aerially broadcasted twice over the entire atoll (2.5km2) at rates of 80kg/ha and 75kg/ha and a supplemental hand broadcast application (71.6kg/ha) occurred three weeks after the second aerial application over a 10ha area. We documented brodifacoum residues in soil, water, and biota, and documented mortality of non-target organisms. Some bait (14–19\% of the target application rate) entered the marine environment to distances 7m from the shore. After the application commenced, carcasses of 84 animals representing 15 species of birds, fish, reptiles and invertebrates were collected opportunistically as potential non-target mortalities. In addition, fish, reptiles, and invertebrates were systematically collected for residue analysis. Brodifacoum residues were detected in most (84.3\%) of the animal samples analyzed. Although detection of residues in samples was anticipated, the extent and concentrations in many parts of the food web were greater than expected. Risk assessments should carefully consider application rates and entire food webs prior to operations using rodenticides.},

Most existing studies of marine recreation ecology have focused on behavioural changes resulting from direct interactions between humans and wildlife including provisioning. However, non-consumptive, non-provisioning human impacts may also result in persistent behavioural impacts to shark populations. In this study, we examined differences in residency, abundance, and behaviour of reef sharks at Palmyra Atoll in response to long-term SCUBA diving activity, using a combination of survey techniques including baited remote underwater video systems and multi-year passive acoustic monitoring. In most locations with recreational diving operations, some level of human impact is pervasive, but on Palmyra, extractive fishing is prohibited, and scientific diving activities are concentrated on just a few sites that house long-term monitoring projects. These sites experience relatively intensive diving, while the majority of the island is entirely undived. Evidence from elsewhere has shown that sharks behaviourally respond to people in the water over short time scales, but our results indicate that this response may not persist. We did not detect differences in reef shark abundance or behaviour between heavily dived and undived locations, nor were there differences in shark residency patterns at dived and undived sites in a year with substantial diving activity and a year without any diving. Our results suggest that humans can interact with reef sharks without persistent behavioural impacts, and that well-regulated shark diving tourism can be accomplished without undermining conservation goals.},

	abstract = {Predation shapes many fundamental aspects of ecology. Uncertainty remains, however, about whether predators can influence patterns of temporal niche construction at ecologically relevant timescales. Partitioning of time is an important mechanism by which prey avoid interactions with predators. However, the traits that control a prey organism's capacity to operate during a particular portion of the diel cycle are diverse and complex. Thus, diel prey niches are often assumed to be relatively unlikely to respond to changes in predation risk at short timescales. Here we present evidence to the contrary. We report results that suggest that the anthropogenic depletion of daytime active predators (species that are either diurnal or cathemeral) in a coral reef ecosystem is associated with rapid temporal niche expansions in a multi-species assemblage of nocturnal prey fishes. Diurnal comparisons of nocturnal prey fish abundance in predator rich and predator depleted reefs at two atolls revealed that nocturnal fish were approximately six (biomass) and eight (density) times more common during the day on predator depleted reefs. Amongst these, the prey species that likely were the most specialized for nocturnal living, and thus the most vulnerable to predation (i.e. those with greatest eye size to body length ratio), showed the strongest diurnal increases at sites where daytime active predators were rare. While we were unable to determine whether these observed increases in diurnal abundance by nocturnal prey were the result of a numerical or behavioral response, either effect could be ecologically significant. These results raise the possibility that predation may play an important role in regulating the partitioning of time by prey and that anthropogenic depletions of predators may be capable of causing rapid changes to key properties of temporal community architecture.},

Yet, stable isotope data from the present study suggest that substantial resource partitioning occurs among tropical seabird communities, both between and within species. In the present study, we compared δ13C and δ15N levels among 8 sympatric tropical seabird species. For a subset of these species, we also examined isotopic levels across years, breeding periods, and sexes. When breeding and non-breeding periods were both considered, we found that all species occupied distinct isotopic niches across at least one time period. Resource partitioning by age (within the same year) and year studied (for birds of the same age), within species was observed in all the species we examined. However, niche separation by sex appeared to be relatively uncommon even in sexually dimorphic species. As a group, seabirds were isotopically distinct from other marine predators. There was a strong correlation between both body mass and wing loading ratios and foraging area, as evaluated using δ13C levels. Cumulatively, the isotopic patterns observed are consistent with diet-based surveys of resource partitioning during the breeding period. Importantly, these data provide additional evidence to suggest that substantial niche partitioning among tropical seabird species persists even during non-breeding periods in open ocean environments, when direct diet-based surveys are difficult to conduct.},

	abstract = {Palmyra Atoll has four partially isolated lagoons up to 50 m in depth, each with complex and variable bottom topographies. Measurements of depth, temperature, salinity, turbidity and dissolved oxygen (DO) revealed a well-mixed shallow surface layer (0–10 m depth) and below that pronounced stratification of DO in the absence of a pycnocline. Turbidity increased in a step-like manner at {\textasciitilde}25 m depth, at the oxycline. For all deep sections of the lagoon ({\textgreater}30 m), DO declined uniformly to 0\% saturation. As determined from filtration, mass of particulates was independent of depth. Surface mixing and deep-water stratification are both stable at different temporal scales, including day versus night, daily, weekly and annually. We suggest that lagoon circulation is represented by a shallow, westward-moving surface layer of well-to-partially mixed water with high DO and low turbidity, underlain by a relatively static and temporally stable layer with low to zero DO and elevated turbidity. This is the first report of such conditions within a deep lagoon system, and only the second report of anoxic conditions in any such system. In deep-water, stable euxinic conditions reflect bottom topography, with dysoxic and anoxic water being constrained within silled basins. The occurrence and depth of large volumes of sediment-laden and dysoxic/anoxic water need to be considered in management proposals designed to increase water flow through the lagoon. These novel water column conditions most probably arose as a consequence of military construction work, consistent with published reports of profound changes to the atoll during 1940–1945. If so, they highlight the need to better understand the possible consequences of cutting channels and modification of lagoon flow at many atolls across the central Pacific Ocean.},

OCN014 recreated signs of disease in experimentally infected corals in a temperature-dependent manner. Genes in OCN014 with expression levels positively correlated with temperature were identified using a transposon-mediated genetic screen. Mutant strains harbouring transposon insertions in two such genes, toxR (a toxin regulator) and mshA (the 11th gene of the 16-gene mannose-sensitive hemagglutinin (MSHA) type IV pilus operon), had reduced infectivity of A. cytherea. Deletion of toxR and the MSHA operon in a second strain of V. coralliilyticus, OCN008, that induces acute Montipora white syndrome in a temperature-independent manner had similarly reduced virulence.

Central place foragers (CPF) may form groups from which they will predictably disperse to forage, either individually or in smaller groups, before returning to fuse with the larger group. However, the function and stability of social associations in predatory fish acting as CPFs is unknown, as individuals do not need to return to a shelter yet show fidelity to core areas. Using dynamic social networks generated from acoustic tracking data, we document spatially structured sociality in CPF grey reef sharks at a Pacific Ocean atoll. We show that sharks form stable social groups over multiyear periods, with some dyadic associations consistent for up to 4 years. Groups primarily formed during the day, increasing in size throughout the morning before sharks dispersed from the reef at night. Our simulations suggest that multiple individuals sharing a central place and using social information while foraging (i.e. local enhancement) will outperform non-CPF social foragers. We show multiyear social stability in sharks and suggest that social foraging with information transfer could provide a generalizable mechanism for the emergence of sociality with group central place foraging.},

	abstract = {Apex predators may have a strong regulatory function in marine ecosystems
through both density and behaviorally mediated effects. Understanding the ecological
impacts of apex predators is particularly important in predator dominated ecosystems
where intra-specific competition may be high. While a number of techniques are
available for quantifying predator movement patterns and distribution, little is known of
the causative factors that regulate these behaviors. One important aspect of predator
behavior is foraging, and an important regulating aspect of foraging is digestion. To
advance our understanding of the interrelationship between gastric function and foraging
behavior, I tested two types of data loggers for deployment in shark stomachs. One type
of tag measured stomach acidity, the other the motility of the stomach wall. Both types
of tags were deployed in the stomachs of captive free-swimming blacktip reef sharks to
determine the effects of feeding and fasting on gastric digestive function. Gastric pH was
maintained low during long periods of fasting, suggesting continuous secretion of acid.
Gastric motility was higher for meals of mackerel than for similar sized meals of squid
with maximum motility occurring at meal sizes of 1 \% body weight. Based on diel
patterns of gastric motility and pH, I predict that blacktips will feed daily and preferably
forage during times of low water temperature.
Palmyra Atoll is a remote, predator dominated ecosystem, and has a large
population of blacktip reef sharks. Blacktips at Palmyra are smaller than those at other
locations, which may be the result of food-limited growth due to intra-specific
competition. Palmyra consists of two lagoons (east and west), and abundance of sharks
appears to be similar in both lagoons. Active and passive tracking was used to study the movement patterns of the sharks at Palmyra. Sharks in the west lagoon utilized small
home ranges over scales of days to weeks. Adult sharks selected ledge habitats, while
smaller individuals selected sand-flats, and small pups were found in very shallow
waters. Fractal analysis revealed that sharks used patches that were 3 – 17 \% of the
spatial scale of their home range, and that sharks move with a directed walk while in
patches but move randomly between patches.
Sharks in the west lagoon showed strong site fidelity with some individuals being
detected there for over 3 years. Sharks showed little movements between lagoons and
sharks in the east lagoon had shorter residence times. Sharks in the west lagoon had
higher body condition indices than those in the east lagoon and stable isotope analysis
revealed that trophic structure was different between the two lagoons. Conditions differ
between the two lagoons which may be driving differences in foraging success. This
study reveals the importance habitat can play in the movement patterns, home range and
foraging success of sharks and suggests that intra-specific competition could be a strong
regulator of apex predator populations in pristine predator dominated ecosystems.
Studies of the digestive system revealed that physiology may also regulate some aspects
of movement patterns, although field studies will be required to test these hypotheses.},

Seven taxon-specific models showed that turbidity exacerbated while prior exposure to higher background temperatures alleviated bleaching, with these predictors explaining an average 16.3\% and 11.5\% variation in prevalence patterns, respectively. Positive associations occurred between bleaching prevalence and both immediate temperature during the bleaching event (average 8.4\% variation explained) and increased sand cover (average 3.7\%). Despite these associations, mean unexplained variation in prevalence equalled 59\%. Lower bleaching prevalence in areas experiencing higher background temperatures suggests acclimation to temperature stress among several coral genera, while WWII modifications may still be impacting the reefs via shoreline sediment re-distribution and increased turbidity, exacerbating coral bleaching susceptibility during periods of high temperature stress.},

We applied network theory to 4 years of acoustic telemetry data for grey reef sharks (Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos) at Palmyra, an unfished atoll, to assess their potential role in nutrient dynamics throughout this remote ecosystem. We evaluated the dynamics of habitat connectivity and used network metrics to quantify shark-mediated nutrient distribution. Predator movements were consistent within year, but differed between years and by sex. Females used higher numbers of routes throughout the system, distributing nutrients over a larger proportion of the atoll. Extrapolations of tagged sharks to the population level suggest that prey consumption and subsequent egestion leads to the heterogeneous deposition of 94.5 kg d−1 of nitrogen around the atoll, with approximately 86\% of this probably derived from pelagic resources. These results suggest that sharks may contribute substantially to nutrient transfer from offshore waters to near-shore reefs, subsidies that are important for coral reef health.},

A combination of metagenomics, microscopy, culturing, and water chemistry were used to characterize microbial communities on four coral atolls in the Northern Line Islands, central Pacific. Kingman, a small uninhabited atoll which lies most northerly in the chain, had microbial and water chemistry characteristic of an open ocean ecosystem. On this atoll the microbial community was equally divided between autotrophs (mostly Prochlorococcus spp.) and heterotrophs. In contrast, Kiritimati, a large and populated (∼5500 people) atoll, which is most southerly in the chain, had microbial and water chemistry characteristic of a near-shore environment. On Kiritimati, there were 10 times more microbial cells and virus-like particles in the water column and these microbes were dominated by heterotrophs, including a large percentage of potential pathogens. Culturable Vibrios were common only on Kiritimati. The benthic community on Kiritimati had the highest prevalence of coral disease and lowest coral cover. The middle atolls, Palmyra and Tabuaeran, had intermediate densities of microbes and viruses and higher percentages of autotrophic microbes than either Kingman or Kiritimati. The differences in microbial communities across atolls could reflect variation in 1) oceaonographic and/or hydrographic conditions or 2) human impacts associated with land-use and fishing. The fact that historically Kingman and Kiritimati did not differ strongly in their fish or benthic communities (both had large numbers of sharks and high coral cover) suggest an anthropogenic component in the differences in the microbial communities. Kingman is one of the world's most pristine coral reefs, and this dataset should serve as a baseline for future studies of coral reef microbes. Obtaining the microbial data set, from atolls is particularly important given the association of microbes in the ongoing degradation of coral reef ecosystems worldwide.},

	abstract = {Live coral cover (LCC) is regarded as the most efficient indicator of coral reef health. However, LCCs are usually sampled with standardized transect or photo quadrat techniques in field, which are incomplete and labour-intensive. To overcome such difficulties, we study a model to transfer the pixels of multispectral satellite images to quantitative LCCs. The idea is to extend band ratio-based (BR) indices to a novel index constructed using the ratio of different linear combinations (RDLC) of band reflectance and water depths. On the basis of field surveyed LCCs, an empirical process is further proposed to solve the unknown parameters of this RDLC. This approach provides new thinking for designing LCC-sensitive indices for given multispectral satellite images. The experimental results on Weizhou Island and Palmyra Atoll demonstrate that the method is effective and feasible, where the mean relative errors (MREs) are improved from 45 to 56\% for BRs to 23\&\#x2013;29\% for RDLCs for Weizhou Island.},

	abstract = {Coral reefs are highly diverse ecosystems where symbioses play a pivotal role. Corals contain cell-associated microbial aggregates (CAMA), yet little is known about how widespread they are among coral species or the nature of the symbiotic relationship. Using histology, we found CAMA within 24 species of corals from 6 genera from Hawaii, American Samoa, Palmyra, Johnston Atoll, Guam, and Australia. Prevalence (\%) of infection varied among coral genera: Acropora, Porites, and Pocillopora were commonly infected whereas Montipora were not. Acropora from the Western Pacific were significantly more likely to be infected with CAMA than those from the Central Pacific, whereas the reverse was true for Porites. Compared with apparently healthy colonies, tissues from diseased colonies were significantly more likely to have both surface and basal body walls infected. The close association of CAMA with host cells in numerous species of apparently healthy corals and lack of associated cell pathology reveals an intimate agent-host association. Furthermore, CAMA are Gram negative and in some corals may be related to chlamydia or rickettsia. We propose that CAMA in adult corals are facultative secondary symbionts that could play an important ecological role in some dominant coral genera in the Indo-Pacific. CAMA are important in the life histories of other animals, and more work is needed to understand their role in the distribution, evolution, physiology, and immunology of reef corals.},

The Palmyra Atoll National Wildlife Refuge, one of the Northern Line Islands in the Central Pacific, contains a regionally significant green turtle Chelonia mydas foraging ground. Residency patterns of this species were investigated through satellite telemetry (n = 15 males, 1 female, 2 subadults) and flipper tagging (n = 555) between 2008 and 2013. Almost every captured turtle was flipper-tagged, but telemetry efforts focused primarily on adult males, which have been studied infrequently. Overall, the turtles tracked during 4076 transmission days (mean = 227, range = 37 to 633) had high site fidelity and small home ranges, and remained close to their capture sites in waters ≤50 m deep. Five turtles were tracked for {\textgreater}1 yr, but none left Palmyra on annual breeding migrations. Only one satellite-tracked turtle departed the atoll, covering a total distance of {\textasciitilde}5600 km in a near-circular loop. Similarly, flipper tag recaptures on the atoll (n = 67) occurred near the original capture site. However, additional tags were recovered from 1 female in Kiritimati, Northern Line Islands, and from 1 subadult in Kosrae, Micronesia, {\textasciitilde}690 and 3800 km away from Palmyra, respectively. Such extended, spatially restricted residency with low turnover is expected in small, high-quality habitats. The study highlights the importance of this protected area, which harbors regionally endangered turtles whose movements over several years are almost entirely encompassed within its established boundaries.},

New ΔR values are reported for the atoll archipelago of the Marshall Islands, eastern Micronesia. Atolls consist of biogenetic material—mostly coral and foraminifera—that can be directly dated for establishing sequences of atoll emergence and islet development. After sectioning and examination using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to screen for sample diagenesis, 6 pristine branch coral samples were selected from the modern oceanside beach, 3 archaeological sites, and islet developmental facies from Ebon Atoll (4º34′N, 168º41′E). Each sample was analyzed by U-series and accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) 14C showing no substantial temporal ΔR variations and yielding a weighted mean ΔR of 41±42 yr1 spanning {\textasciitilde}500 yr before earliest human colonization (the period when islets first became habitable) through the entire 2000-yr occupation sequence.

At dozens of locations, concentrations of elements exceeded established soil and marine sediment thresholds for adverse ecological effects.

Subsequent surveys revealed CM to be overgrowing the reef benthos, including corals and coralline algae, potentially placing coral ecosystems in the atoll at risk. This prompted the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the lead management agency of the atoll, to remove the shipwreck. Subsequent surveys showed reductions in CM around the ship impact site. We explain patterns of spread of the CM in terms of both life history and local currents and show with a pilot study that pulverized bleach may be an effective tool to eradicate CM on a local scale. If applied strategically, particularly in heavily infested ({\textgreater} 66\% cover) areas, active intervention such as this could be an effective management tool to reduce CM impact on localized areas and decrease colonization rate of remaining reefs. This is the first documentation of the response of an invasive cnidarian to shipwreck removal. While this was a singular event in Palmyra, the spatial and temporal patterns of this invasion and the eradications lessons described herein, are useful for anticipating and controlling similar situations elsewhere.},

	abstract = {Invasive rodents (primarily Rattus spp.) are responsible for loss of biodiversity in island ecosystems worldwide. Large-scale rodenticide applications are typically used to eradicate rats and restore ecological communities. In tropical ecosystems, environmental conditions rapidly degrade baits and competition for baits by non-target animals can result in eradication failure. Our objective was to evaluate persistence of rodenticide baits during a rat eradication program on Palmyra Atoll; a remote tropical atoll with intense competition for resources by land crabs. Following aerial application, bait condition was monitored in four terrestrial environments and in the canopy foliage of coconut palms. Ten circular PVC hoops were fixed in place in each of Palmyra’s four primary terrestrial habitats and five rodenticide pellets were placed in each hoop. Five coconut palms were selected in three distinct regions of the atoll. One rodenticide pellet was placed on each of five palm fronds in each coconut palm. Fresh baits were placed in all monitoring locations after each broadcast bait application. Bait condition and survival was monitored for 7 days after the first bait application and 6 days after second application. Bait survival curves differed between applications at most monitoring sites, suggesting a decrease in overall rat activity as a result of rodenticide treatment. One terrestrial site showed near 100 \% bait survival after both applications, likely due to low localized rat and crab densities. Median days to pellet disappearance were one and two days for the first and second application, respectively. Differences in survival curves were not detected in canopy sites between bait applications. Median days to pellet disappearance in canopy sites were 2 and 4 days for the first and second application, respectively. Frequent rainfall likely contributed to rapid degradation of bait pellets in coconut palm fronds.},

	abstract = {The Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus, appears to have been extirpated from Palmyra Atoll following rat eradication. Anecdotal biting reports, collection records, and regular captures in black-light traps showed the species was present before rat eradication. Since then, there have been no biting reports and no captures over 2 years of extensive trapping (black-light and scent traps). By contrast, the southern house mosquito, Culex quinquefasciatus, was abundant before and after rat eradication. We hypothesize that mammals were a substantial and preferred blood meal for Aedes, whereas Culex feeds mostly on seabirds. Therefore, after rat eradication, humans and seabirds alone could not support positive population growth or maintenance of Aedes. This seems to be the first documented accidental secondary extinction of a mosquito. Furthermore, it suggests that preferred host abundance can limit mosquito populations, opening new directions for controlling important disease vectors that depend on introduced species like rats.},

	abstract = {Animal movements, residence times, and subsequently foraging strategies, should vary with habitat quality. We used acoustic and satellite telemetry, as well as stable isotopes, to look at movement patterns, macro-scale habitat use, and trophic ecology of blacktip reef sharks, Carcharhinus melanopterus, between two lagoons (eastern and western) at Palmyra Atoll, a US National Wildlife Refuge in the central Pacific. Sharks in the Palmyra lagoons have relatively small home ranges and appear to obtain most of their energy from the lagoon ecosystem. Sharks showed low levels of migration between lagoons over periods of several years, and individuals in the larger western lagoon tended to have longer residence times than those in the smaller eastern lagoon. Furthermore, for sharks in the western lagoon, there was no relationship between total length (TL) and δ15N, 13C relative isotope concentrations, or a Body Condition index (BC). For sharks in the eastern lagoon, TL was positively related to δ15N and negatively related to δ13C and BC. These results suggest that there are low levels of mixing of sharks between lagoons, and these are leading to differences in trophic ecology and potentially foraging success. Although the causative factors behind these differences are unknown, shark home range location can potentially lead to variation in trophic ecology, even over small spatial scales.},

	abstract = {Understanding trophic relationships among marine predators in remote environments is challenging, but it is critical to understand community structure and dynamics. In this study, we used stable isotope analysis of skin biopsies to compare the isotopic, and thus, trophic niches of three sympatric delphinids in the waters surrounding Palmyra Atoll, in the Central Tropical Pacific: the melon-headed whale (Peponocephala electra), Gray’s spinner dolphin (Stenella longirostris longirostris), and the common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus). δ15N values suggested that T. truncatus occupied a significantly higher trophic position than the other two species. δ13C values did not significantly differ between the three delphinds, potentially indicating no spatial partitioning in depth or distance from shore in foraging among species. The dietary niche area—determined by isotopic variance among individuals—of T. truncatus was also over 30\% smaller than those of the other species taken at the same place, indicating higher population specialization or lower interindividual variation. For P. electra only, there was some support for intraspecific variation in foraging ecology across years, highlighting the need for temporal information in studying dietary niche. Cumulatively, isotopic evidence revealed surprisingly little evidence for trophic niche partitioning in the delphinid community of Palmyra Atoll compared to other studies. However, resource partitioning may happen via other behavioral mechanisms, or prey abundance or availability may be adequate to allow these three species to coexist without any such partitioning. It is also possible that isotopic signatures are inadequate to detect trophic partitioning in this environment, possibly because isotopes of prey are highly variable or insufficiently resolved to allow for differentiation.},

Here, we combine 8 yr of benthic monitoring data from permanent photoquadrats with remotely sensed and in situ temperature measurements to assess the impact of the warming event on benthic communities at Palmyra Atoll. We quantified bleaching prevalence across two distinct reef habitats using the best available data. On the fore reef ({\textasciitilde} 10 m depth), we quantified bleaching severity within 100–200 m2 large-area plots using the custom visualization and analysis software, Viscore. On the reef terrace ({\textasciitilde} 5 m depth), we used 95 focal colonies across three species that have been monitored annually since 2014. The 2015–2016 warm water event was the most extreme such event recorded on Palmyra in the past several decades with a maximum cumulative heat stress (degree heating weeks) of 11.9 °C-weeks. On the fore reef, 90\% of live coral cover exhibited some degree of bleaching (32\% severe bleaching). On the shallow reef terrace, bleaching was observed in 93\% of the focal colonies across all species.Overall, coral cover declined 9\% on the fore reef from 2014 to 2017, whereas coral cover did not change on the terrace. These contrasting results may be associated with typical daily temperature ranges on the terrace that are three times greater than on the fore reef. Permanent photoquadrats showed that turf algae initially colonized skeletons of recently dead corals but transitioned to crustose coralline algae within a year. Collectively, our study emphasizes that comprehensive monitoring of benthic communities over time combined with in situ temperature data can provide taxonomically precise trajectories of community change during and following thermal stress.},

	abstract = {Rat eradication has become a common conservation intervention in island ecosystems and its effectiveness in protecting native vertebrates is increasingly well documented. Yet, the impacts of rat eradication on plant communities remain poorly understood. Here we compare native and non-native tree and palm seedling abundance before and after eradication of invasive rats (Rattus rattus) from Palmyra Atoll, Line Islands, Central Pacific Ocean. Overall, seedling recruitment increased for five of the six native trees species examined. While pre-eradication monitoring found no seedlings of Pisonia grandis, a dominant tree species that is important throughout the Pacific region, post-eradication monitoring documented a notable recruitment event immediately following eradication, with up to 688 individual P. grandis seedlings per 100m2 recorded one month post-eradication. Two other locally rare native trees with no observed recruitment in pre-eradication surveys had recruitment post-rat eradication. However, we also found, by five years post-eradication, a 13-fold increase in recruitment of the naturalized and range-expanding coconut palm Cocos nucifera. Our results emphasize the strong effects that a rat eradication can have on tree recruitment with expected long-term effects on canopy composition. Rat eradication released non-native C. nucifera, likely with long-term implications for community composition, potentially necessitating future management interventions. Eradication, nevertheless, greatly benefitted recruitment of native tree species. If this pattern persists over time, we expect long-term benefits for flora and fauna dependent on these native species.},

	abstract = {As coral cover declines globally, management of remaining reefs is increasingly important. Even remote and ̀pristine' reefs are not free from anthropogenic impacts. Biological invasions have been observed in the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument on Palmyra Atoll, a National Wildlife Refuge, and on Kingman Reef. A corallimorph, Rhodactis howesii, was observed on the reefs and is causing phase-shifts on coral dominated habitat. Phase-shifts can lead to loss of ecosystem services by altering the physical structure and characteristics of the reef. The invasions have been linked to shipwrecks at Palmyra Atoll and Kingman Reef. In 1991, a vessel grounded on the Palmyra reef terrace and subsequent growth of R. howesii was observed. The corallimorph now covers ̃2km² of the reef. Rhodactis howesii has also been observed around the wreck at Kingman Reef and the invasion mechanisms are largely unknown. It has been hypothesized that shipwreck iron has added a limiting nutrient to the waters, facilitating corallimorph growth. Population genetics, trace metal analysis, enrichment experiments, and in situ monitoring of the corallimorph were used to test this hypothesis. Results show increasing populations of the corallimorph at both proximal and distal sites to the wreck but a lack of correlation between iron content and proximity to the wreck. Additionally, exposure to shipwreck metal resulted in decreased growth and mortality of the corallimorph, suggesting that metal levels had a toxic effect. These results further an understanding of this invasive species and assist in advancing management strategies on reefs impacted by similar invasions},

	abstract = {For sessile organisms such as reef-building corals, differences in the degree of dispersion of individuals across a landscape may result from important differences in life-history strategies or may reflect patterns of habitat availability. Descriptions of spatial patterns can thus be useful not only for the identification of key biological and physical mechanisms structuring an ecosystem, but also by providing the data necessary to generate and test ecological theory. Here, we used an in situ imaging technique to create large-area photomosaics of 16 plots at Palmyra Atoll, central Pacific, each covering 100 m2 of benthic habitat. We mapped the location of 44,008 coral colonies and identified each to the lowest taxonomic level possible. Using metrics of spatial dispersion, we tested for departures from spatial randomness. We also used targeted model fitting to explore candidate processes leading to differences in spatial patterns among taxa. Most taxa were clustered and the degree of clustering varied by taxon. A small number of taxa did not significantly depart from randomness and none revealed evidence of spatial uniformity. Importantly, taxa that readily fragment or tolerate stress through partial mortality were more clustered. With little exception, clustering patterns were consistent with models of fragmentation and dispersal limitation. In some taxa, dispersion was linearly related to abundance, suggesting density dependence of spatial patterning. The spatial patterns of stony corals are non-random and reflect fundamental life-history characteristics of the taxa, suggesting that the reef landscape may, in many cases, have important elements of spatial predictability.},

Coral oxygen isotopic (δ18O) and strontium to calcium (Sr/Ca) records are often used to extend instrumental observations; however, differences in the mean Sr/Ca and δ18O values of Porites spp. colonies from the same reef can introduce large uncertainties in coral-based climate reconstructions. To quantify intercolony variability at Palmyra Atoll, we generate monthly resolved Sr/Ca and δ18O time series from five Porites spp. colonies that grew between 1980 and 2010. Monthly to interannual variability in Sr/Ca and δ18O is well-reproduced among different colonies; however, we document intercolony offsets in mean Sr/Ca of ±0.09 mmol/mol (1σ) or 1 °C, and in mean δ18O of ±0.12‰ (1σ) or 0.1 °C. The sensitivity of each proxy to climate also varies across colonies, with Sr/Ca-SST slopes ranging from −0.06 to −0.1 mmol mol−1 °C−1 and δ18O-SST slopes ranging from −0.25 to −0.35‰ °C−1. Intercolony variability in both coral Sr/Ca and δ18O reduces the reproducibility of coral-based δ18Osw reconstructions across overlapping colonies. Accounting for both intercolony variability and slope error suggests that SST reconstructions using Sr/Ca from a single Palmyra coral have an uncertainty of ±1.3 °C (1σ); however, replicating Sr/Ca records across multiple colonies can greatly reduce this uncertainty. A composite Sr/Ca record built using five modern cores, for example, offers a reduced error of ±0.6 °C (1σ) in mean SST reconstructions, 2.5 times smaller than errors associated with reconstructions from single corals.},

Previous authors have extended nonlinear time-series forecasting to continuous spatial data. Here, we adjust spatial forecasting to handle discrete data and apply the technique to explore the ubiquity of nonlinear determinism in irregular spatial configurations of coral and algal taxa from Palmyra Atoll, a relatively pristine reef in the central Pacific Ocean. We find that the spatial distributions of coral and algal taxa show signs of nonlinear determinism in some locations and that these signals can change through time. We introduce the hypothesis that nonlinear spatial determinism may be a signal of systems in intermediate developmental (i.e. successional) stages, with spatial randomness characterizing early (i.e. recruitment dominated) and late-successional (i.e. ‘climax’ or attractor) phases. Common state-based metrics that sum community response to environmental forcing lack resolution to detect dynamics of (potential) recovery phases; incorporating signal of spatial patterning among sessile taxa holds unique promise to elucidate dynamical characters of complex ecological systems, thereby enhancing study and response efforts.},

Recently, machine learning algorithms have been adopted to infer social associations from time-series data gathered using remote, telemetry systems situated at provisioning sites. We adapt and modify existing inference methods to reveal the underlying social structure of wide-ranging marine predators moving through spatial arrays of passive acoustic receivers. From six months of tracking data for grey reef sharks (Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos) at Palmyra atoll in the Pacific Ocean, we demonstrate that some individuals emerge as leaders within the population and that this behavioural coordination is predicted by both sex and the duration of co-occurrences between conspecifics. In doing so, we provide the first evidence of long-term, spatially extensive social processes in wild sharks. To achieve these results, we interrogate simulated and real tracking data with the explicit purpose of drawing attention to the key considerations in the use and interpretation of inference methods and their impact on resultant social structure. We provide a modified translation of the GMMEvents method for R, including new analyses quantifying the directionality and duration of social events with the aim of encouraging the careful use of these methods more widely in less tractable social animal systems but where passive telemetry is already widespread.},

In many cases, it remains unclear whether algae are responsible, directly or indirectly, for coral death or whether they simply settle on dead coral surfaces. Here, we show that algae can indirectly cause coral mortality by enhancing microbial activity via the release of dissolved compounds. When coral and algae were placed in chambers together but separated by a 0.02 μm filter, corals suffered 100\% mortality. With the addition of the broad-spectrum antibiotic ampicillin, mortality was completely prevented. Physiological measurements showed complementary patterns of increasing coral stress with proximity to algae. Our results suggest that as human impacts increase and algae become more abundant on reefs a positive feedback loop may be created whereby compounds released by algae enhance microbial activity on live coral surfaces causing mortality of corals and further algal growth.},

Here, Palmyra Atoll was used as a case study to examine the response of an intact coral reef community to biotic and abiotic stressors in the form of a species invasion and bleaching event. Techniques from the fields of spatial, chemical, and microbial ecology were used to investigate the response of benthic communities to these disturbances. A decade-long, spatially robust dataset found contrasting patterns in the invasion of a corallimorph, Rhodactis howesii, around the atoll. Decreasing cover of R. howesii was observed at the epicenter of the invasion, but contrasted sharply with increased spread and cover of the corallimorph at additional sites. Sites with high coral cover and low levels of disturbance experienced lower levels of invasion, while sites with high wave energy and lower coral cover experienced increased corallimorph growth. Competitive mechanisms of the corallimorph were examined using an assay that found evidence of bioactive chemical compounds present in R. howesii tissue that caused coral mortality. To further investigate the impact of invasion on coral health, 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing of coral-corallimorph interaction zones showed shifts in coral-associated microbial communities with increasing proximity to R. howesii. Overgrown coral tissue was dominated by bacterial families strongly associated with stress and disease, suggesting that the corallimorph can directly impact coral colonies through microbial community alteration. Evidence of acclimatization was found by studying the response and recovery of coral-associated bacterial communities to the global stressor of the 2015-16 bleaching event. Although microbial community composition shifted as a result of bleaching, healthy symbionts were maintained in coral tissue and pathogenic bacterial invasion was not observed. These data, in combination with the low mortality at Palmyra, support the hypothesis that natural temperature variability may lead to a more resilient community in the face of thermal stress. Collectively, the results of my dissertation provide valuable insight into the response of coral communities to invasion and their ability to adapt to increasing thermal stress events over time. This dissertation also highlights the importance of long-term and spatially robust data sets that allow for accurate quantification of reef trajectories in response to disturbance events.},

	abstract = {Invasive rodent eradications are frequently undertaken to curb island biodiversity loss. However, the breadth of rodents’ ecological impact, even after eradication, is not always fully recognized. For example, the most widespread invasive rodent, the black rat (Rattus rattus), while omnivorous, eats predominantly seeds and fruit. Yet, the effects of seed predation release after eradication on plant communities and ecological functions are not well understood, posing a gap for island restoration. We examined the role of seed predation release following black rat eradication in changes to tree composition and aboveground biomass across an islet network (Palmyra Atoll) in the Central Pacific. We conducted repeated surveys of seed, juvenile, and adult tree biomass and survival in permanent vegetation plots before and after the eradication of rats. We observed a 95\% reduction in seed predation for an introduced, previously cultivated tree population (Cocos nucifera). Juvenile tree biomass of all species increased 14-fold, with C. nucifera increasing the most, suggesting that eradication increased this tree's competitive advantage. Indeed, based on stage-structured demographic models, rat eradication led to a 10\% increase in C. nucifera population growth rate. The effect of invasive rodent seed predation varies considerably among the plant species in a community and can shift competitive dynamics, sometimes in favor of invasive plants. These bottom-up effects should be considered in evaluating the costs and benefits of eradication. Documenting the variation in invasive rodent diet items, along with long-term surveys, can help prioritize island eradications where restoration is most likely to be successful.},

	abstract = {The relationship between species richness and area is one of the oldest, most recognized patterns in ecology. Here we provide empirical evidence for strong impacts of fisheries exploitation on the slope of the species–area relationship (SAR). Using comparative field surveys of fish on protected and exploited reefs in three oceans and the Mediterranean Sea, we show that exploitation consistently depresses the slope of the SAR for both power-law and exponential models. The magnitude of change appears to be proportional to fishing intensity. Results are independent of taxonomic resolution and robust across coral and rocky reefs, sampling protocols and statistical methods. Changes in species richness, relative abundance and patch occupancy all appear to contribute to this pattern. We conclude that exploitation pressure impacts the fundamental scaling of biodiversity as well as the species richness and spatial distribution patterns of reef fish. We propose that species–area curves can be sensitive indicators of community-level changes in biodiversity, and may be useful in quantifying the human imprint on reef biodiversity, and potentially elsewhere.},

However, the ecological role that environmental variables play in holobiont distribution remains poorly understood. We compared the drivers of symbiont and coral species distributions at Palmyra Atoll, a location with a range of reef environments from low to high sediment concentrations (1–52 g dry weight m−2 day−1). We observed uniform holobiont partnerships across the atoll (e.g. Montipora spp. with Symbiodinium type C15 at all sites). Multivariate analysis revealed that field-based estimates of settling sediment predominantly explained the spatial variation of coral species among sites (P {\textless} 0.01). However, none of the environmental variables measured (sedimentation, temperature, chlorophyll concentration, salinity) affected symbiont distribution. The discord between environmental variables and symbiont distributions suggests that the symbionts are physiologically tolerant of the variable environmental regime across this location and that the distribution of different host–symbiont combinations present is largely dependent on coral rather than Symbiodinium physiology. The data highlight the importance of host tolerance to environmental stressors, which should be considered simultaneously with symbiont sensitivity when considering the impact of variations in environmental conditions on coral communities.},

Although passive long-distance dispersal (LDD) of Chtonobdella leeches by birds has been suggested, little is known about the host–parasite relationships between avian hosts and Chtonobdella leeches. In the current study, we investigated Chtonobdella leech infestations of the eyes and other mucus membranes of migratory procellariiform seabirds, Pterodroma hypoleuca and Oceanodroma tristrami, captured at six locations in the Bonin Islands, Honshu and Okinawa Island, Japan. Analyses of the partial sequences of 18S rRNA, 28S rRNA, and mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) and morphological examination of the specimens demonstrated that the Chtonobdella leeches belonged to Chtonobdella palmyrae, which is indigenous to Palmyra Atoll in the Northern Line Islands. A dominant COI sequence type was observed in samples from all six sites; therefore, C. palmyrae almost surely dispersed approximately 1000 km by infesting the eyes and mucus membranes of procellariiform seabirds. The host–parasite relationships between procellariiform seabirds and C. palmyrae provide explicit evidence of the LDD of duognathous haemadipsid leeches.

	abstract = {The effect of Ocean Acidification (OA) on marine biota is quasi-predictable at best. While perturbation studies, in the form of incubations under elevated pCO2, reveal sensitivities and responses of individual species, one missing link in the OA story results from a chronic lack of pH data specific to a given species' natural habitat. Here, we present a compilation of continuous, high-resolution time series of upper ocean pH, collected using autonomous sensors, over a variety of ecosystems ranging from polar to tropical, open-ocean to coastal, kelp forest to coral reef. These observations reveal a continuum of month-long pH variability with standard deviations from 0.004 to 0.277 and ranges spanning 0.024 to 1.430 pH units. The nature of the observed variability was also highly site-dependent, with characteristic diel, semi-diurnal, and stochastic patterns of varying amplitudes. These biome-specific pH signatures disclose current levels of exposure to both high and low dissolved CO2, often demonstrating that resident organisms are already experiencing pH regimes that are not predicted until 2100. Our data provide a first step toward crystallizing the biophysical link between environmental history of pH exposure and physiological resilience of marine organisms to fluctuations in seawater CO2. Knowledge of this spatial and temporal variation in seawater chemistry allows us to improve the design of OA experiments: we can test organisms with a priori expectations of their tolerance guardrails, based on their natural range of exposure. Such hypothesis-testing will provide a deeper understanding of the effects of OA. Both intuitively simple to understand and powerfully informative, these and similar comparative time series can help guide management efforts to identify areas of marine habitat that can serve as refugia to acidification as well as areas that are particularly vulnerable to future ocean change.},

The incidence and severity of bleaching is often spatially heterogeneous within reef-scales ({\textless}1 km), and is therefore not predictable using conventional remote sensing products. Here, we systematically assess the relationship between in situ measurements of 20 environmental variables, along with seven remotely sensed SST thermal stress metrics, and 81 observed bleaching events at coral reef locations spanning five major reef regions globally. We find that high-frequency temperature variability (i.e., daily temperature range) was the most influential factor in predicting bleaching prevalence and had a mitigating effect, such that a 1 °C increase in daily temperature range would reduce the odds of more severe bleaching by a factor of 33. Our findings suggest that reefs with greater high-frequency temperature variability may represent particularly important opportunities to conserve coral ecosystems against the major threat posed by warming ocean temperatures.},

	abstract = {Shipwrecks can have significant localized effects when grounded on shallow coral reefs. These effects are not limited to the immediate physical damage, but can have wide-spread and lasting impacts due to alteration of the chemical makeup of the surrounding water column. This can subsequently impact the growth of benthic organisms, often leading to phase shifts and high levels of mortality of corals in the vicinity of the wreck. At Palmyra atoll, the grounding of a longline fishing vessel on the shallow reef terrace is associated with a phase shift to the corallimorph, Rhodactis howesii. In 2013, a wreck removal effort initiated by the US Department of Fish and Wildlife resulted in the successful extraction and disposal of the wreckage, after which the density and percent cover of R. howesii in the immediate vicinity of the wreck site dropped precipitously. Here, we document the response of the fish community to the wreck removal and localized decline in R. howesii. We show that the biomass of scarid parrotfishes and acanthurid surgeonfishes and unicornfishes (primarily herbivores) increased after the removal of the wreck, while biomass of chaetodontid butterflyfishes (primarily invertivores, many species are known to feed on coelenterate polyps) declined over the study period. The density of small scarids and acanthurids also increased, but only after a few years post removal. Overall these results indicate that Palmyra’s unfished herbivore population has rapidly responded to the removal of the wreck and associated decrease in corallimorph cover, can maintain high levels of grazing where space is made available for colonization of early successional algae species, and may have the potential to facilitate reef recovery.},

Strong interference competition can drive habitat separation, but less is known of the role of interference if agonistic interactions are weak. While most theoretical models assume interference abilities to be constant in an environment, few consider that the extent of interference can vary by habitat and change model predictions. Using baited underwater cameras, we show a consistent dominance status between two sympatric reef sharks at an uninhabited Pacific atoll. Blacktip reef shark (Carcharhinus melanopterus) and gray reef shark (Carcharhinus amblyrhyncos) relative abundance showed an inverse relationship to each other but the strength of this relationship varied by habitat. Reef shark relative abundance declined more rapidly in the presence of heterospecifics on forereef habitats as opposed to backreefs. In all habitats, gray reef sharks were more likely to bite bait cages than blacktips when both species were present, and appeared to be the dominant species. Intraspecific interactions were also apparent, with individual willingness to bite bait decreasing as the number of conspecifics increased. Gray reef sharks may exert differential control over blacktip foraging success in different habitats. Habitat-specific behavioral interactions may partially explain patterns of spatial separation between competing species where interference is weak.},

Here, we describe the growth, maximum size, sex ratios, size at maturity, and offer a direct estimate of survival of an unfished population of grey reef sharks (Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos) using data from an eight year tag-recapture study. We then synthesized published information on the life history of C. amblyrhynchos from across its geographic range, and for the first time, we attempted to disentangle the contribution of fishing from geographic variation in an elasmobranch species. For Palmyra’s unfished C. amblyrhynchos population, the von Bertalanffy growth function (VBGF) growth coefficient k was 0.05 and asymptotic length L∞ was 163.3 cm total length (TL). Maximum size was 175.5 cm TL from a female shark, length at maturity was estimated at 116.7–123.2 cm TL for male sharks, maximum lifespan estimated from VBGF parameters was 18.1 years for both sexes combined, and annual survival was 0.74 year-1. Consistent with findings from studies on other elasmobranch species, we found significant intraspecific variability in reported life history traits of C. amblyrhynchos. However, contrary to what others have reported, we did not find consistent patterns in life history variability as a function of biogeography or fishing. Ultimately, the substantial, but not yet predictable variability in life history traits observed for C. amblyrhynchos across its geographic range suggests that regional management may be necessary to set sustainable harvest targets and to recover this and other shark species globally.},

	abstract = {We conducted gross and microscopic characterizations of lesions in Cnidaria from Palmyra Atoll, Central Pacific. We found growth anomalies (GA) to be the most commonly encountered lesion. Cases of discoloration and tissue loss were rare. GAs had a focal or multi-focal distribution and were predominantly nodular, exophytic, and umbonate. In scleractinians, the majority of GAs manifested as hyperplasia of the basal body wall (52\% of cases), with an associated absence or reduction of polyp structure (mesenteries and filaments, actinopharynx and tentacles), and depletion of zooxanthellae in the gastrodermis of the upper body wall. In the soft corals Sinularia sp. and Lobophytum sp., GAs exclusively manifested as prominent hyperplasia of the coenenchyme with an increased density of solenia. In contrast to scleractinians, soft coral GAs displayed an inflammatory and necrotizing component with marked edema of the mesoglea, accompanied by infiltrates of variably-sized granular amoebocytes. Fungi, algae, sponges, and Crustacea were present in some scleractinian GAs, but absent in soft coral GAs. Fragmentation of tissues was a common finding in Acropora acuminata and Montipora cf. dilatata colonies with tissue loss, although no obvious causative agents were seen. Discoloration in the zoanthid, Palythoa tuberculosa, was found to be the result of necrosis, while in Lobophytum sp. discoloration was the result of zooxanthellar depletion (bleaching). Soft corals with discoloration or tissue loss showed a marked inflammatory response, however no obvious causative organisms were seen. Lesions that appeared similar at the gross level were revealed to be distinct by microscopy, emphasizing the importance of histopathology.},

	abstract = {Growth anomalies (GAs) are common, tumor-like diseases that can cause significant morbidity and decreased fecundity in the major Indo-Pacific reef-building coral genera, Acropora and Porites. GAs are unusually tractable for testing hypotheses about drivers of coral disease because of their pan-Pacific distributions, relatively high occurrence, and unambiguous ease of identification. We modeled multiple disease-environment associations that may underlie the prevalence of Acropora growth anomalies (AGA) (n = 304 surveys) and Porites growth anomalies (PGA) (n = 602 surveys) from across the Indo-Pacific. Nine predictor variables were modeled, including coral host abundance, human population size, and sea surface temperature and ultra-violet radiation anomalies. Prevalence of both AGAs and PGAs were strongly host density-dependent. PGAs additionally showed strong positive associations with human population size. Although this association has been widely posited, this is one of the first broad-scale studies unambiguously linking a coral disease with human population size. These results emphasize that individual coral diseases can show relatively distinct patterns of association with environmental predictors, even in similar diseases (growth anomalies) found on different host genera (Acropora vs. Porites). As human densities and environmental degradation increase globally, the prevalence of coral diseases like PGAs could increase accordingly, halted only perhaps by declines in host density below thresholds required for disease establishment.},

	abstract = {Microbialization refers to the observed shift in ecosystem trophic structure towards higher microbial biomass and energy use. On coral reefs, the proximal causes of microbialization are overfishing and eutrophication, both of which facilitate enhanced growth of fleshy algae, conferring a competitive advantage over calcifying corals and coralline algae. The proposed mechanism for this competitive advantage is the DDAM positive feedback loop (dissolved organic carbon (DOC), disease, algae, microorganism), where DOC released by ungrazed fleshy algae supports copiotrophic, potentially pathogenic bacterial communities, ultimately harming corals and maintaining algal competitive dominance. Using an unprecedented data set of {\textgreater}400 samples from 60 coral reef sites, we show that the central DDAM predictions are consistent across three ocean basins. Reef algal cover is positively correlated with lower concentrations of DOC and higher microbial abundances. On turf and fleshy macroalgal-rich reefs, higher relative abundances of copiotrophic microbial taxa were identified. These microbial communities shift their metabolic potential for carbohydrate degradation from the more energy efficient Embden–Meyerhof–Parnas pathway on coral-dominated reefs to the less efficient Entner–Doudoroff and pentose phosphate pathways on algal-dominated reefs. This ‘yield-to-power’ switch by microorganism directly threatens reefs via increased hypoxia and greater CO2 release from the microbial respiration of DOC.},

	abstract = {Despite widespread climate-driven reductions of coral cover on tropical reefs, little attention has been paid to the possibility that changes in the geographic distribution of coral recruitment could facilitate beneficial responses to the changing climate through latitudinal range shifts. To address this possibility, we compiled a global database of normalized densities of coral recruits on settlement tiles (corals m-2) deployed from 1974 to 2012, and used the data therein to test for latitudinal range shifts in the distribution of coral recruits. In total, 92 studies provided 1253 records of coral recruitment, with 77\% originating from settlement tiles immersed for 3-24 mo, herein defined as long-immersion tiles (LITs); the limited temporal and geographic coverage of data from short-immersion tiles (SITs; deployed for {\textless}3 mo) made them less suitable for the present purpose. The results from LITs show declines in coral recruitment, on a global scale (i.e. 82\% from 1974 to 2012) and throughout the tropics (85\% reduction at {\textless}20° latitude), and increases in the sub-tropics (78\% increase at {\textgreater}20° latitude). These trends indicate that a global decline in coral recruitment has occurred since 1974, and the persistent reduction in the densities of recruits in equatorial latitudes, coupled with increased densities in sub-tropical latitudes, suggests that coral recruitment may be shifting poleward.},

Many of these species are also important fishery targets, yet little is known about their global status. Using a large-scale synthesis of peer-reviewed and unpublished data, we examine variability in abundance and biomass of herbivorous reef fishes and explore evidence for fishing impacts globally and within regions. We show that biomass is more than twice as high in locations not accessible to fisheries relative to fisheries-accessible locations. Although there are large biogeographic differences in total biomass, the effects of fishing are consistent in nearly all regions. We also show that exposure to fishing alters the structure of the herbivore community by disproportionately reducing biomass of large-bodied functional groups (scraper/excavators, browsers, grazer/detritivores), while increasing biomass and abundance of territorial algal-farming damselfishes (Pomacentridae). The browser functional group that consumes macroalgae and can help to prevent coral–macroalgal phase shifts appears to be most susceptible to fishing. This fishing down the herbivore guild probably alters the effectiveness of these fishes in regulating algal abundance on reefs. Finally, data from remote and unfished locations provide important baselines for setting management and conservation targets for this important group of fishes.},

We analyzed B calls from passive acoustic data collected between 2010 and 2013 at 2 low-latitude sites, Palmyra Atoll and the Hawaiian Islands, and 3 higher-latitude sites, off southern California, off Washington state and in the Gulf of Alaska. Frequency measurements were extracted along the contour of the third harmonic from each call, and data from each region were compared. Calls from the Gulf of Alaska and Hawai‘i presented a downshift in frequency, beginning just past the midway point of the contour, which was not present in calls recorded from southern California or Palmyra Atoll. Calls from Washington displayed intermediate characteristics between those from the other 2 high-latitude sites. Cluster analysis resulted in consistent grouping of call contours from Washington and southern California, in what we termed the NEP B1 variant, while contours from Hawai‘i and the Gulf of Alaska were grouped together, as a NEP B2 variant. Frequency differences were also observed among the variants; the Gulf of Alaska displayed the highest frequency on average, followed by Washington, then southern California. Consistent with other studies, a yearly decline in the frequency of B calls was also observed. This discovery of at least 2 geographically distinct variants provides the first evidence of vocally distinct subpopulations within the NEP, indicating the possibility of a need for finer-scale population segmentation.},

Here we report on the persistence of a long ecological interaction chain linking diverse food webs and habitats in the near-pristine portions of a remote Pacific atoll. Using biogeochemical assays, animal tracking and field surveys we show that seabirds roosting on native trees fertilize soils, increasing coastal nutrients and the abundance of plankton, thus attracting manta rays to native forest coastlines. Partnered observations conducted in regions of this atoll where native trees have been replaced by human propagated palms reveal that this complex interaction chain linking trees to mantas readily breaks down. Taken together these findings provide a compelling example of how anthropogenic disturbance may be contributing to widespread reductions in ecological interaction chain length, thereby isolating and simplifying ecosystems.},

Equating the divergence of the shoreward energy flux to its dissipation by bottom friction and parameterizating dissipation in terms of the root-mean-square velocity cubed, we find that the wave friction factor, fw, for this reef is 1.80 ± 0.07, nearly an order of magnitude larger than values previously found for reefs. We attribute this remarkably high value of fw to the complex canopy structure of the reef, which we believe may be characteristic of healthy reefs.

Using stomach content and stable isotope (δ15N and δ13C) analyses, we examined consistency across islands in estimated foraging patterns. Surprisingly, species within the piscivore–invertivore group exhibited the clearest pattern of foraging consistency across all five islands despite there being a considerable difference in mean body mass (14 g–1.4 kg) and prey size (0.03–3.8 g). In contrast, the diets and isotopic values of the grazer–detritivores varied considerably and exhibited no consistent patterns across islands. When examining foraging patterns across environmental contexts, we found that δ15N values of species of piscivore–invertivore and planktivore closely tracked gradients in oceanic primary production; again, no comparable patterns existed for the grazer–detritivores. The inter-island consistency in foraging patterns within the species of piscivore–invertivore and planktivore and the lack of consistency among species of grazer–detritivores suggests a linkage to different sources of primary production among reef fish functional groups. Our findings suggest that piscivore–invertivores and planktivores are likely linked to well-mixed and isotopically constrained allochthonous oceanic primary production, while grazer–detritivores are likely linked to sources of benthic primary production and autochthonous recycling. Further, our findings suggest that species of piscivore–invertivore, independent of body size, converge toward consuming low trophic level prey, with a hypothesized result of reducing the number of steps between trophic levels and increasing the trophic efficiency at a community level.},

	abstract = {Fishing has clear direct effects on harvested species, but its cascading, indirect effects are less well understood. Fishing disproportionately removes larger, predatory fishes from marine food webs. Most studies of the consequent indirect effects focus on density‐mediated interactions where predator removal alternately drives increases and decreases in abundances of successively lower trophic‐level species. While prey may increase in number with fewer predators, they may also alter their behavior. When such behavioral responses impact the food resources of prey species, behaviorally mediated trophic cascades can dramatically shape landscapes. It remains unclear whether this pathway of change is typically triggered by ocean fishing. By coupling a simple foraging model with empirical observations from coral reefs, we provide a mechanistic basis for understanding and predicting how predator harvest can alter the landscape of risk for herbivores and consequently drive dramatic changes in primary producer distributions. These results broaden trophic cascade predictions for fisheries to include behavioral changes. They also provide a framework for detecting the presence and magnitude of behaviorally mediated cascades. This knowledge will help to reconcile the disparity between expected and observed patterns of fishing‐induced cascades in the sea.},

	abstract = {Despite the ubiquity and ecological importance of parasites, relatively few studies have assessed their response to anthropogenic environmental change. Heuristic models have predicted both increases and decreases in parasite abundance in response to human disturbance, with empirical support for both. However, most studies focus on one or a few selected parasite species. Here, we assess the abundance of parasites of seven species of coral reef fishes collected from three fished and three unfished islands of the Line Islands archipelago in the central equatorial Pacific. Because we chose fish hosts that spanned different trophic levels, taxonomic groups, and body sizes, we were able to compare parasite responses across a broad cross section of the total parasite community in the presence and absence of fishing, a major human impact on marine ecosystems. We found that overall parasite species richness was substantially depressed on fished islands, but that the response of parasite abundance varied among parasite taxa: directly transmitted parasites were significantly more abundant on fished than on unfished islands, while the reverse was true for trophically transmitted parasites. This probably arises because trophically transmitted parasites require multiple host species, some of which are the top predators most sensitive to fishing impacts. The increase in directly transmitted parasites appeared to be due to fishing-driven compensatory increases in the abundance of their hosts. Together, these results provide support for the predictions of both heuristic models, and indicate that the direction of fishing's impact on parasite abundance is mediated by parasite traits, notably parasite transmission strategies.},

	abstract = {Herbivory by fishes and sea urchins is a powerful mechanism on coral reefs that mitigates coral-algal competition by physically removing algae and creating bare space. Spatially constrained grazing by herbivores, particularly parrotfishes, may foster coral recruitment by creating a spatially continuous refuge of bare substrate for settlement and survival. However, frequent bouts of concentrated feeding potentially remove newly settled corals. Understanding the frequency and intensity of parrotfish foraging behavior at appropriate scales (months and meters) is essential for connecting herbivory with benthic processes. We documented the foraging behavior of a large, mobile coral reef herbivore (the steephead parrotfish Chlorurus microrhinos) on Palmyra Atoll using various techniques (observational follows, fish surveys, and bite scar tracking) across 2 habitat states (one dominated by algal turfs, one dominated by live coral and crustose coralline algae) that are representative of reefs throughout the Central Pacific. Large differences in the abundance of a preferred resource were associated with major differences in feeding behavior. Where resources were abundant and regrew quickly, foraging areas were small and spatially focused, resulting in dense patches of bite scars ({\textgreater}100 bites m-2). Feeding behavior also showed a temporal periodicity, with individuals defending and regrazing the same area after regrowth occurred. In areas where resources were less abundant and recovered more slowly, parrotfish movements and foraging areas were significantly larger and bites were distributed sparsely across food patches. The large variability we observed within a single atoll suggests that characterizing species-specific foraging patterns from small-scale studies may not be appropriate.},

Modeling results have shown that SAG formations together with shoaling waves induce a nearshore Lagrangian circulation pattern of counter-rotating circulation cells, but these have never been observed in the field. We present results from two separate field studies of SAG formations on Palmyra Atoll which show their effect on waves to be small, but reveal a persistent order 1 cm/s depth-averaged Lagrangian offshore flow over the spur and onshore flow over the grooves. This circulation was stronger for larger, directly incident waves and low alongshore flow conditions, consistent with predictions from modeling. Favorable forcing conditions must be maintained on the order of 1 h to accelerate and develop the SAG circulation cells. The primary cross and alongshore depth-averaged momentum balances were between the pressure gradient, radiation stress gradient, and nonlinear convective terms, and the bottom drag was similar to values found on other reefs. The vertical structure of these circulation cells was previously unknown and the results show a complex horizontal offshore Lagrangian flow over the spurs near the surface driven by alongshore variability in radiation stress gradients. Vertical flow was downward over the spur and upward over the groove, likely driven by alongshore differences in bottom stress and not by vortex forcing.},

data from the western Indian Ocean, Taiwan, the Great Barrier Reef, and the tropical east Pacific (n = 298) to examine phylogeographic relationships more broadly. Mitochondrial markers revealed six distinct clades, while nuclear data (ITS-2) resolved no clear groups due in part to intragenomic
variation. Although colony-level morphology is highly variable within each mitochondrial clade, microscopic corallite-level morphology showed less variation and stronger concordance with mitochondrial groups, and one clade was found only in the Hawaiian Archipelago. These findings will assist

	abstract = {The indirect, ecosystem-level consequences of ocean fishing, and particularly the mechanisms driving them, are poorly understood. Most studies focus on density-mediated trophic cascades, where removal of predators alternately causes increases and decreases in abundances of lower trophic levels. However, cascades could also be driven by where and when prey forage rather than solely by prey abundance. Over a large gradient of fishing intensity in the central Pacific's remote northern Line Islands, including a nearly pristine, baseline coral reef system, we found that changes in predation risk elicit strong behavioral responses in foraging patterns across multiple prey fish species. These responses were observed as a function of both short-term ("acute") risk and longer-term ("chronic") risk, as well as when prey were exposed to model predators to isolate the effect of perceived predation risk from other potentially confounding factors. Compared to numerical prey responses, antipredator behavioral responses such as these can potentially have far greater net impacts (by occurring over entire assemblages) and operate over shorter temporal scales (with potentially instantaneous response times) in transmitting top-down effects. A rich body of literature exists on both the direct effects of human removal of predators from ecosystems and predators' effects on prey behavior. Our results draw together these lines of research and provide the first empirical evidence that large-scale human removal of predators from a natural ecosystem indirectly alters prey behavior. These behavioral changes may, in turn, drive previously unsuspected alterations in reef food webs.},

	url = {https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/11849259},
	abstract = {This dissertation combines field and modeling studies in coastal ecosystems to better understand high resolution ecosystem metabolism, the resulting natural variability in seawater carbonate chemistry, and to gain insights into the future of coastal ecosystems in a warmer and more acidic future. Chapter 1 uses high-resolution physical oceanography and biogeochemistry to quantify spatial and temporal variability in net community calcification and production on Palmyra Atoll, an isolated coral reef atoll in the central Pacific. I show that environmental controls, such as light and temperature, are the primary predictors of calcification and primary production. However, the ratio of inorganic to organic production, the ultimate control on the overlying water chemistry, is much more closely controlled by benthic community composition. Chapter 1 suggests that overlying water chemistry is very sensitive to the benthic community composition on a coral reef and that the biogeochemical variability is likely to change following human disturbances to the benthic community. Chapter 2 uses high-temporal resolution physical oceanography and biogeochemistry to study the back reefs of Ofu, American Samoa. This is the first study to document the biogeochemical variability on this coral reef. I show that the reef regularly experiences pH minima not expected until near the end of the century and ecosystem metabolism has a very low inorganic to organic production ratio. This study highlights the biogeochemical variability of back reef sites and argues for their continued study as a window into the future extremes on coral reefs in a changing climate. Chapter 3 complements the field-based approaches of Chapters 1 and 2 by using numerical modeling to explore a localized solution to combat nearshore acidification. I use an empirically validated, process-based model to explore the efficacy of nighttime bubble stripping in shallow water ecosystems as a means to reduce carbonate chemistry variability. I demonstrate that bubbling ventilates coastal ecosystems by one to two orders of magnitude faster than wind-speed based estimates of gas exchange. By coupling bubble stripping to a coastal ecosystem metabolism model, I demonstrate that strategically timed nighttime bubble stripping results in small reductions to present-day diel carbonate chemistry variability and that this variability is further reduced in simulations of end-of-century conditions. This chapter concludes with a consideration of the engineering requirements for scaling bubble stripping from laboratory-based test tanks to field-based coastal settings. Chapter 4 applies the field-based observational skills I developed in Chapters 1 and 2 to a central California kelp forest. I present a carbonate chemistry time series of six locations within a kelp forest in Pacific Grove, California spanning July 2013-August 2014, each with samples collected near the surface and near the bottom. I describe the spatial and temporal patterns of biogeochemical and hydrographic variability in the kelp forest. I then analyze the biological and physical controls on the observed carbonate chemistry variability. Finally, I discuss how the observed spatial and temporal differences within the kelp forest create a unique opportunity for studying organismal adaptation to biogeochemical variability as well as a unique challenge for future coastal ocean acidification monitoring efforts. Together these four chapters provide new observations and tools to better understand coastal biogeochemistry so that we may manage our coastal resources in an era of unprecedented global environmental change.},

	url = {http://researcharchive.vuw.ac.nz/handle/10063/6148},
	abstract = {Coral recruitment and calcium carbonate (CaCO₃) accretion are fundamental processes that help maintain coral reefs. Many reefs worldwide have experienced degradation, including a decrease in coral cover and biodiversity. Successful coral recruitment helps degraded reefs to recover, while CaCO₃ accretion by early successional benthic organisms maintains the topographic complexity of a coral reef system. It is therefore important to understand the processes that affect coral recruitment and CaCO₃ accretion rates in order to understand how coral reefs recover from disturbances. 
 
The aim of this thesis was to determine how biophysical forcing factors affect coral recruitment, calcification and bioerosion on a pristine coral reef. I used artificial settlement tiles to measure coral recruitment and CaCO₃ accretion at ten sites (four on the fore reef, four on the Western Reef Terrace and two at the Entrance Channel) at Palmyra Atoll. Fungia skeletons and pieces of dead coral rock were used to measure bioerosion rates, which were combined with the CaCO₃ accretion rates to obtain a net CaCO₃ budget of the reef substratum. Interactions between coral recruits and other benthic organisms on the settlement tiles were recorded to determine the settlement preferences and competitive strength of coral recruits. The settlement preference of Pocillopora damicornis for divots shaped like steephead and bumphead parrotfish bites marks was determined by adding P. damicornis larvae to a container with a settlement tile with the aforementioned divots. 
 
I found that coral recruitment and CaCO₃ accretion are influenced by biophysical forcing factors. Most pocilloporids likely recruit close to their parents while the origin of poritid larvae is much more distant. Pocilloporid recruitment rates were also significantly correlated with the successional stage of the benthic community on the settlement tiles, especially the cover of biofilm and bryozoa. Biofilm and crustose coralline algae (CCA) were preferred as settlement substrata by coral larvae, however both pocilloporids and poritids settled on a large number of different benthic substrata. P. damicornis larvae showed a significant settlement preference for divots shaped like parrotfish bite marks over a flat settlement surface. Coral recruits were good competitors against encrusting algae but were often outcompeted by filamentous and upright algae. Settlement tiles were almost entirely colonised by benthic organisms within three to twelve months of deployment. The mass of CaCO₃ deposited onto the settlement tiles negatively correlated with herbivore grazing pressure on the benthic community. Bioerosion rates within pieces of coral (internal bioerosion) increased over time but overall bioerosion rates (internal and external) rarely exceeded CaCO₃ deposition by CCA. 
 
My results show how variability in biophysical forcing factors leads to natural variation in coral recruitment and CaCO₃ accretion. This thesis highlights the importance of measuring herbivore grazing, CCA and turf algae cover to gain a better understanding of reef resilience. I conclude that models constructed for Caribbean reefs may not be suited to predict resilience in Pacific reefs and that within the Pacific, two different kinds of resilience models need to be constructed, one for human-inhabited coral reefs and one for uninhabited coral reefs.},

Benthic communities in fore reef areas (10 m depth) were dominated by reef builders (coral and crustose coralline algae) covering {\textasciitilde}50\% of the benthos, while turf algae, macroalgae, soft corals, and other invertebrates covered the remaining surfaces. Species of Halimeda, Lobophora, Dictyosphaeria, Galaxaura and Dichotomaria were among the 5 most common macroalgae recorded. Overall, the reef communities around Palmyra appear relatively healthy.

The structures of the new compounds, apratoxins F and G, were determined by 1D and 2D NMR techniques in combination with mass spectrometric methods. Stereochemistry was explored by using chromatographic analyses of the hydrolytically released fragments in combination with NMR and optical rotation comparisons with known members of the apratoxin family. Apratoxins F and G add fresh insights into the SAR of this family because they incorporate an N-methyl alanine residue at a position where all prior apratoxins have possessed a proline unit, yet they retain high potency as cytotoxins to H-460 cancer cells with IC50 values of 2 and 14 nM, respectively. Additional assays using zone inhibition of cancer cells and clonogenic cells give a comparison of the activities of apratoxin F to apratoxin A. Additionally, the clonogenic studies in combination with maximum tolerated dose (MTD) studies provided insights as to dosing schedules that should be used for in vivo studies, and preliminary in vivo evaluation validated the predicted in vivo efficacy for apratoxin A. These new apratoxins are illustrative of a mechanism (the modification of an NRPS adenylation domain specificity pocket) for evolving a biosynthetic pathway so as to diversify the suite of expressed secondary metabolites.},

The sites under consideration have not been the subject of previous studies for coral classification using remote sensing data. Previous research regarding using remote sensing to identify reefs has been limited to in-situ assessment, with some researchers also performing temporal analysis of a selected area of interest. This study expanded the previous in-situ analyses by evaluating the ability of a basic predictor, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), trained on Depth Invariant Indices calculated from the spectral signature of coral in one location to generalize to other locations, both within the same scene and in other scenes. Three Landsat 8 scenes were selected and masked for null, land, and obstructed pixels, and corrections for sun glint and atmospheric interference were applied. Depth Invariant Indices (DII) were then calculated according to the method of Lyzenga and an LDA classifier trained on ground truth data from a single scene. The resulting LDA classifier was then applied to other locations and the coral classification accuracy evaluated. When applied to ground truth data from the Palmyra Atoll location in scene path/row 065/056, the initial model achieved an accuracy of 80.3\%. However, when applied to ground truth observations from another location within the scene, namely, Kingman Reef, it achieved an accuracy of 78.6\%. The model was then applied to two additional scenes (Howland Island and Baker Island Atoll), which yielded an accuracy of 69.2\% and 71.4\%, respectively. Finally, the algorithm was retrained using data gathered from all four sites, which produced an overall accuracy of 74.1\%.},

We sought to understand how well LSMPAs could benefit nine highly-mobile marine species in the tropics now and into the future by: 1) evaluating current range overlap within a LSMPA; 2) evaluating range overlap under climate change projections; and 3) evaluating how well theoretical MPA designs benefit these nine species. We focused on Palmyra Atoll and Kingman Reef, a 2000 km2 area within the 1.2 million km2 U.S. Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument (PRIMNM) that contains marine megafauna (reef and pelagic fishes; sea turtles; seabirds; cetaceans) reflecting different behaviors and habitat use. Our approach is useful for evaluating the effectiveness of the Palmyra-Kingman MPA and PRIMNM in protecting these species, and tropical LSMPAs in general, and for informing future MPA design. Stationary MPAs provided protection at varying scales. Reef manta rays (Mobula alfredi), grey reef sharks (Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos), green sea turtles (Chelonia mydas), and bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) had overall small ranges ({\textless}100 km from Palmyra-Kingman) and could benefit from stationary MPAs that contained heterogenous reef habitats. Yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares), sooty terns (Onychoprion fuscatus), red-footed boobies (Sula sula), great frigatebirds (Fregata minor), and melon-headed whales (Peponocephala electra) navigated complex oceanographic processes and may benefit most from mobile MPAs that shift with features including thermal fronts, cyclic regions of elevated productivity, and eddies, if relationships with these features are established and predictable. All species had capacity to travel to nearby reef systems, illustrating potential benefits of MPA networks and protected corridors. Suitable habitats will likely contract for all species as warm water expands under climate change scenarios (species habitats were predicted to decrease by 4–49\% at Palmyra-Kingman) and MPAs may not protect suitable habitats into the future. Species habitat requirements and movement ecologies are critical aspects of marine spatial planning, especially with respect to dynamic ocean processes and a changing climate.},

The specimens from Micronesia showed a remarkable difference from those collected at the 12 other localities, and those from Tahiti showed a significant difference from those collected at ten other localities, but not New Caledonia and Samoa. Furthermore, significant differences were found between the North Pacific Ocean region, except Ambon Island, and South Pacific Ocean regions and Réunion Island, while there were few differences between specimens from the Indian and South Pacific Ocean regions. It appears likely, based on this morphological analysis and the geographic range of this species, that there are at least four or more populations of A. marmorata as has been indicated previously by molecular genetic research.},

	abstract = {Accurately surveying shark populations is critical to monitoring precipitous ongoing declines in shark abundance and interpreting the effects that these reductions are having on ecosystems. To evaluate the effectiveness of existing survey tools, we used field trials and computer simulations to critically examine the operation of four common methods for counting coastal sharks: stationary point counts, belt transects, video surveys, and mark and recapture abundance estimators. Empirical and theoretical results suggest that (1) survey method selection has a strong impact on the estimates of shark density that are produced, (2) standardizations by survey duration are needed to properly interpret and compare survey outputs, (3) increasing survey size does not necessarily increase survey precision, and (4) methods that yield the highest density estimates are not always the most accurate. These findings challenge some of the assumptions traditionally associated with surveying mobile marine animals. Of the methods we trialed, 8 × 50 m belt transects and a 20 m radius point count produced the most accurate estimates of shark density. These findings can help to improve the ways we monitor, manage, and understand the ecology of globally imperiled coastal shark populations.},

	abstract = {Observation network data comprise animal presences detected by observer stations at fixed spatial locations. Statistical analysis of these data is complicated by spatial bias in sampling and temporal variability in detection conditions. Advanced methods for analysis of these data are required but are currently underdeveloped. We propose a state-space model (SSM) for observation network data to estimate detailed movements of individual animals. The underlying movement model is an Ornstein–Uhlenbeck (OU) process, which is stationary, and therefore has an inherent mechanism that models home range behaviour. An integral part of the approach is the detection function, which models the probability of logging animal presences. The detection function is also used to provide absence information when animals are undetected. Since the ability to detect an animal often depends on time-varying external factors such as environmental conditions, we use covariate information about detection efficiency as control variables. Via simulation, we found that movement estimation error scales log-linearly with network sparsity. This result can be used to indicate the number of stations necessary to achieve a desired upper bound on estimation error. Furthermore, we found that the SSM outperforms existing techniques in terms of estimating detailed movements and that estimates are robust towards mis-specification of the detection function. We also tested the importance of accounting for time-varying detection conditions and found that the probability of making wrong conclusions decreases substantially when covariate information is exploited. The model is used to estimate movements and home range of a humphead wrasse (Cheilinus undulatus) at Palmyra Atoll in the central Pacific Ocean. Here, detection conditions have a strong diel component, which is controlled for using detection efficiency information from a reference device. The presented approach enhances the toolbox for analysis of observation network data as collected by acoustic telemetry or potentially other aspiring methods such as camera trapping and mobile phone tagging. By explicitly modelling movement and observation processes, the model integrates all sources of uncertainty and provides a sound statistical basis for making well-informed management decisions from imperfect information.},

	abstract = {Accurate predictions of how coral reefs may respond to global climate change hinge on understanding the natural variability to which these ecosystems are exposed and to which they contribute. We present high-resolution estimates of net community calcification (NCC) and net community production (NCP) from Palmyra Atoll, an uninhabited, near-pristine coral reef ecosystem in the central Pacific. In August–October 2012, we employed a combination of Lagrangian and Eulerian frameworks to establish high spatial ({\textasciitilde}2.5 km2) and temporal (hourly) resolution coral community metabolic estimates. Lagrangian drifts, all conducted during daylight hours, resulted in NCC estimates of −51 to 116 mmol C m−2 h−1, although most NCC estimates were in the range of 0–40 mmol C m−2 h−1. Lagrangian drift NCP estimates ranged from −7 to 67 mmol C m−2 h−1. In the Eulerian setup, we present carbonate system parameters (dissolved inorganic carbon, total alkalinity, pH, and pCO2) at sub-hourly resolution through several day–night cycles and provide hourly NCC and NCP rate estimates. We compared diel cycles of all four carbonate system parameters to the offshore surface water (0–50 m depth) and show large departures from offshore surface water chemistry. Hourly Eulerian estimates of NCC aggregated over the entire study ranged from 14 to 53 mmol C m−2 h−1, showed substantial variability during daylight hours, and exhibited a diel cycle with elevated NCC in the afternoons and depressed, but positive, NCC at night. The Eulerian NCP range was very high (−55 to 177 mmol C m−2 h−1) and exhibited strong variability during daylight hours. Principal components analysis revealed that NCC and NCP were most closely aligned with diel cycle forcing, whereas the NCC/NCP ratio was most closely aligned with reef community composition. Our analysis demonstrates that ecological community composition is the primary determinant of coral reef biogeochemistry on a near-pristine reef and that reef biogeochemistry is likely to be responsive to human behaviors that alter community composition.},

The records indicate mean climate conditions in the central tropical Pacific ranging from relatively cool and dry during the tenth century to increasingly warmer and wetter climate in the twentieth century. But the corals also document a broad range of ENSO behaviour that correlates poorly with these estimates of mean climate. The most intense ENSO activity within the reconstruction occurred during the mid-seventeenth century. Taken together, the coral data imply that the majority of ENSO variability over the last millennium may have arisen from dynamics internal to the ENSO system itself.},

This study profiled lipids, fatty acids, and microbial communities of healthy and white syndrome (WS) diseased colonies of Acropora hyacinthus sampled from reefs in Western Australia, the Great Barrier Reef, and Palmyra Atoll. Total lipid levels varied significantly among locations, though a consistent stepwise decrease from healthy tissues from healthy colonies (HH) to healthy tissue on WS-diseased colonies (HD; i.e. preceding the lesion boundary) to diseased tissue on diseased colonies (DD; i.e. lesion front) was observed, demonstrating a reduction in energy reserves. Lipids in HH tissues were comprised of high energy lipid classes, while HD and DD tissues contained greater proportions of structural lipids. Bacterial profiling through 16S rRNA gene sequencing and histology showed no bacterial taxa linked to WS causation. However, the relative abundance of Rhodobacteraceae-affiliated sequences increased in DD tissues, suggesting opportunistic proliferation of these taxa. While the cause of WS remains inconclusive, this study demonstrates that the lipid profiles of HD tissues was more similar to DD tissues than to HH tissues, reflecting a colony-wide systemic effect and provides insight into the metabolic immune response of WS-infected Indo-Pacific corals.},

Bigeye catch, the number of hooks per set, and set location from 4884 longline sets spanning January 1994 to December 2003 were used with a temporally corresponding El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) indicator built from sea surface height (SSH) data. Observations of environmental data combined with the results from the GAM indicated that there is an increase in bigeye catch rates corresponding to an increase in eastward advection during the winter months of El Niño events. A seasonal pattern with higher bigeye catch rates from December to April and a spatial pattern with higher rates to the northeast and northwest of the atoll were observed during this study period. It is hypothesized that the combination of the eastward advection of the warm pool coupled with vertical changes in temperature during the winter months of El Niño events increases the availability of bigeye tuna in this region. This increase in availability may be due to a change in exploitable population size, location, or both.},

	abstract = {Two interdisciplinary cruises aimed at relating the ecology of marine fish populations to oceanographic conditions were fielded during the late summer and late winter seasons near Palmyra Atoll (5.9°N, 162.1°W) in the Line Islands. Ocean current and hydrographic measurements revealed interaction of the flow with the steep topography. During the first cruise (August/September 1990) satellite-tracked surface drifters and acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) measurements showed a strong eastward setting North Equatorial Counter Current (NECC) with maximum speeds exceeding 1 m s−1 at 80 m depth approximately. This current turned southeastward on closer approach to Palmyra. The drifter paths exhibited excursions with zonal wavelength of approximately 250 km, meridional amplitude of 25 km and period of approximately 5 days. During the second cruise (February/March 1992), the ADCP-derived speeds of the NECC were weaker (maxima approximately 33 cm s−1) while the relative geostrophic flow component was of magnitude similar to 1990 and the signal of zonal geostrophic currents reached much deeper to approximately 650 m depth (150 m in 1990). Doming isopycnals beneath the surface mixed layer as well as thick (10–25 m) internal mixed layers were found near Palmyra during both cruises, with slightly different positions relative to the island. The discontinuous vertical temperature profiles may have been a result of strong boundary mixing due to breaking internal waves on Palmyra’s steep slopes. In the immediate vicinity of the island variations in flow speed, stratification and “mixing” in both the alongshore and cross-isobath directions were observed. Overall, the current speeds were reduced during February/March 1992, the peak time of the 1991–1993 warm event in the tropical Pacific. While parameters of turbulent two-dimensional wake theory are suggestive of formation and shedding of eddies in the lee of the island, no direct observations of circular motions were made in either expedition.},

	abstract = {While it is well established that ecosystem subsidies—the addition of energy, nutrients, or materials across ecosystem boundaries—can affect consumer abundance, there is less information available on how subsidy levels may affect consumer diet, body condition, trophic position, and resource partitioning among consumer species. There is also little information on whether changes in vegetation structure commonly associated with spatial variation in subsidies may play an important role in driving consumer responses to subsidies. To address these knowledge gaps, we studied changes in abundance, diet, trophic position, size, and body condition of two congeneric gecko species (Lepidodactylus spp.) that coexist in palm dominated and native (hereafter dicot dominated) forests across the Central Pacific. These forests differ strongly both in the amount of marine subsidies that they receive from seabird guano and carcasses, and in the physical structure of the habitat. Contrary to other studies, we found that subsidy level had no impact on the abundance of either gecko species; it also did not have any apparent effects on resource partitioning between species. However, it did affect body size, dietary composition, and trophic position of both species. Geckos in subsidized, dicot forests were larger, had higher body condition and more diverse diets, and occupied a much higher trophic position than geckos found in palm dominated, low subsidy level forests. Both direct variation in subsidy levels and associated changes in habitat structure appear to play a role in driving these responses. These results suggest that variation in subsidy levels may drive important behavioral responses in predators, even when their numerical response is limited. Strong changes in trophic position of consumers also suggest that subsidies may drive increasingly complex food webs, with longer overall food chain length.},

	abstract = {This chapter reviews how seabird inputs contribute and affect island food webs. It looks into how these inputs such as guano, eggs, chicks, adult tissues and carcasses, and food scraps affect island consumers. It discusses the multiple pathways by which seabirds “subsidize” the diets of island consumers, and how this generates many different direct and indirect responses. It addresses how physical disturbance of soils and vegetation alters consumer abundance through modification of habitat and change in resource availability. It also explores variation in the basic trends among island systems within the context of climatic differences, seasonal and pulsed inputs, the influence of native and introduced predators, and the history of seabird presence on islands.},

	abstract = {DNA metabarcoding is an emerging tool used to quantify diet in environments and consumer groups where traditional approaches are unviable, including small-bodied invertebrate taxa. However, metabarcoding of small taxa often requires DNA extraction from full body parts (without dissection), and it is unclear whether surface contamination from body parts alters presumed diet presence or diversity. We examined four different measures of diet (presence, rarefied read abundance, richness, and species composition) for a terrestrial invertebrate consumer (the spider Heteropoda venatoria) both collected in its natural environment and fed an offered diet item in contained feeding trials using DNA metabarcoding of full body parts (opisthosomas). We compared diet from consumer individuals surface sterilized to remove contaminants in 10\% commercial bleach solution followed by deionized water with a set of unsterilized individuals. We found that surface sterilization did not significantly alter any measure of diet for consumers in either a natural environment or feeding trials. The best-fitting model predicting diet detection in feeding trial consumers included surface sterilization, but this term was not statistically significant (β = −2.3, p-value = .07). Our results suggest that surface contamination does not seem to be a significant concern in this DNA diet metabarcoding study for consumers in either a natural terrestrial environment or feeding trials. As the field of diet DNA metabarcoding continues to progress into new environmental contexts with various molecular approaches, we suggest ongoing context-specific consideration of the possibility of surface contamination.},

	abstract = {We examined the influence of depth on sponge assemblages across three lagoons at Palmyra; a remote atoll situated in the Central Pacific. The atoll is unusual in that it was heavily altered during WWII resulting in an atypical lagoon system. We conducted surveys at both 6-8m and 12-14m at 3 sites at the atoll and recorded sponge densities, area cover and available substrate for the 29 species found at these sites. Multivariate analysis of sponge densities and area cover revealed significant variability in sponge assemblages between both site and depth. Univariate analysis also showed significant differences in area cover between depths, but not between sites. Diversity indices and the average number of species at each site showed an increase in diversity across lagoons from West to East. This study indicates that despite the small size of the atoll, depth is a factor that shapes sponge assemblages at Palmyra Atoll. The heavy alterations to the lagoon, particularly the area near the channel entrance may be influencing the sponge assemblage structure, however, other environmental variables still need to be investigated.},

	abstract = {Natural heterogeneity and global change are key environmental drivers of ecosystem structure and function in both terrestrial and marine ecosystems. At the foundation of all food webs are the primary producers, which require macronutrients and photosynthetic substrate in order to fix inorganic carbon into organic sugars and fuel energy transfer into food webs. This dissertation is an examination of the ecophysiology, or the interaction of organismal physiology with the environment, of key benthic primary producers on coral reefs. Reef-building corals and algae are the most abundant primary producers on coral reefs, and I use coarse functional groupings categorized as reef-building corals, fleshy macroalgae, calcareous macroalgae, crustose coralline algae (CCA) and turf algae assemblages. I assessed the influence of, 1) a natural gradient in inorganic nutrient availability, and, 2) simulated global change on the ecophysiology of corals and algae by functional group. The Southern Line Islands are an archipelago of islands that span the equatorial upwelling region and demonstrate predictable heterogeneity in inorganic nutrient availability. The dominant species of corals and algae demonstrated higher pigment concentrations and photosynthetic efficiency across the archipelago as a function of increasing inorganic nutrient concentrations. This suggests that natural fluxes of inorganic nutrients have an important positive influence on primary producers. I then conducted laboratory experiments on Palmyra Atoll and in Moorea, French Polynesia to test the effects of ocean acidification (OA) and warming on different functional groups of algae. Across a suite of species, OA increased the growth of fleshy macroalgae and turf algae assemblages, but decreased growth and calcification of calcareous macroalgae and CCA. Ocean acidification had a stronger effect than warming on the biomass of turf algae assemblages. Positive effects of OA on turf algae metabolism were increased by warming. These findings suggest that fleshy and calcifying algae respond differently to global change stressors. Ocean acidification has the potential to increase growth and productivity of fleshy algae, while concurrently decreasing growth and calcification of calcifying algae. Anthropogenic activities are increasingly altering the natural environment, and the results of this dissertation improve our ability to predict the response of corals and algae to increasing exposure to nutrients, OA and warming in the near-future ocean.},

	abstract = {Invasive and opportunistic species are known to cause turnovers in dominant taxa by rapidly monopolizing space following disturbance events, often producing lasting shifts in community structure provided that environmental conditions remain favorable. On Palmyra Atoll, the corallimorph Rhodactis howesii has become highly invasive and now covers \&gt; 3 km2 of reef radiating outward from a ship grounding that occurred in the early 1990s. In 2014, our team established a corallimorph removal and coral transplantation experiment within the epicenter of the corallimorph outbreak, following shipwreck removal, to determine if restoration is a viable option for recovering previously dominant reef-building taxa. Monitoring of the restoration site ran from 2014-2018 and consisted of annual surveys to assess changes in benthic community structure. By 2018, corallimorph reinvasion in experimental plots where it had been previously removed was negligible and in control plots, corallimorph cover decreased by 99\%. Across the entire site, coral cover increased by 392\%, turf and crustose coralline algae have dominated the remaining benthos, and coral recruits have been observed as well. Additionally, variations in growth rate and asexual propagation among coral transplant species appears to influence benthic community succession. Methods used within this study provide an effective strategy for protecting localized regions of reef most vulnerable to corallimorph invasion, namely those possessing low coral cover and in the initial stages of corallimorph invasion. Additionally, these results suggest that active reef management or restoration can drive changes benthic community succession, but only if the underlying causes of degradation have been removed.},

Here we combine millimeter-scale and micro-scale coral Sr/Ca data, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images, and X-ray diffraction with previously published δ18O records to investigate the effects of submarine and subaerial diagenesis on paleoclimate reconstructions in modern and young sub-fossil corals from the central tropical Pacific. In a 40-year-old modern coral, we find secondary aragonite is associated with relatively high coral δ18O and Sr/Ca, equivalent to sea-surface temperature (SST) artifacts as large as −3 and −5°C, respectively. Secondary aragonite observed in a 350-year-old fossil coral is associated with relatively high δ18O and Sr/Ca, resulting in apparent paleo-SST offsets of up to −2 and −4°C, respectively. Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS) analyses of secondary aragonite yield Sr/Ca ratios ranging from 10.78 to 12.39mmol/mol, significantly higher compared to 9.15±0.37mmol/mol measured in more pristine sections of the same fossil coral. Widespread dissolution and secondary calcite observed in a 750-year-old fossil coral is associated with relatively low δ18O and Sr/Ca. SIMS Sr/Ca measurements of the secondary calcite (1.96–9.74mmol/mol) are significantly lower and more variable than Sr/Ca values from more pristine portions of the same fossil coral (8.22±0.13mmol/mol). Our results indicate that while diagenesis has a much larger impact on Sr/Ca-based paleoclimate reconstructions than δ18O-based reconstructions at our site, SIMS analyses of relatively pristine skeletal elements in an altered coral may provide robust estimates of Sr/Ca which can be used to derive paleo-SSTs.},

Sand flats provide important nonbreeding habitat for Bristle-thighed Curlews (Numenius tahitiensis), a migratory shorebird listed as “vulnerable” by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources. We used camera trapping, observations of focal individuals, and quantification of prey availability and sediment characteristics to assess curlew habitat use across different levels of historical anthropogenic impact. Habitat preferences were not determined by the degree of land reclamation impact on lagoon flat habitat, although the two most preferred sites were both highly impacted. Curlew abundance was most strongly correlated with availability of prey items, such as spionid polychaetes (Malacoceros sp.). Our findings provide new ecological information on a shorebird species that is rarely studied and provides useful information for habitat management at Palmyra Atoll and other curlew wintering grounds.},

Our study represents the first data and discussion on marine turtle distribution, abundance, and health at a marine turtle foraging ground in the central Pacific, Palmyra Atoll National Wildlife Refuge, which constitutes a regionally important mixed-size-class foraging ground for green turtles (Chelonia mydas) and, to a lesser extent, for hawksbill turtles (Eretmochelys imbricata). Surveys and anecdotal reports suggest that nesting activity is rare, and we have confirmed the presence of limited suitable nesting habitat. During in-water activities from 2008 to 2011, we caught 211 green turtles ranging from postpelagic juveniles to adults (weight: mean = 44.6 kg, range = 7.2–146.3 kg; curved carapace length (CCL): mean = 69.7 cm, range = 41.0–113.6 cm) and 2 juvenile hawksbills (weight2009 = 16.3 kg, CCL2009 = 57.0; weight2011 = 11.2 kg, CCL2011 = 50.5 cm). Body condition indices did not significantly differ by year of capture. These indices, along with the absence of observed fibropapilloma tumors, indicated that turtles at Palmyra Atoll were on average in very good condition. We also conducted 11 relative abundance surveys from 2005 to 2011, a subset of which revealed an uneven distribution of turtles around Palmyra Atoll with 3 hot spots of turtle abundance off the flats to the north, south, and east. By linking several aspects of our research program with similar efforts at foraging grounds throughout the Pacific Basin, we can further our understanding of poorly known regional migratory connectivity.},

For ectothermic predators, ambient temperature may also influence daily routines through its effects on physiological performance. Temperatures can fluctuate significantly over the diel cycle and ectotherms may synchronize behaviour to match thermal regimes in order to optimize fitness. We used bio-logging to quantify activity and body temperature of blacktip reef sharks (Carcharhinus melanopterus) at a tropical atoll. Behavioural observations were used to concurrently measure bite rates in herbivorous reef fishes, as an index of activity for potential diurnal prey. Sharks showed early evening peaks in activity, particularly during ebbing high tides, while body temperatures peaked several hours prior to the period of maximal activity. Herbivores also displayed peaks in activity several hours earlier than the peaks in shark activity. Sharks appeared to be least active while their body temperatures were highest and most active while temperatures were cooling, although we hypothesize that due to thermal inertia they were still warmer than their smaller prey during this period. Sharks may be most active during early evening periods as they have a sensory advantage under low light conditions and/or a thermal advantage over cooler prey. Sharks swam into shallow water during daytime low tide periods potentially to warm up and increase rates of digestion before the nocturnal activity period, which may be a strategy to maximize ingestion rates. “Hunt warm, rest warmer” may help explain the early evening activity seen in other ectothermic predators.},

Juvenile densities ranged from 0 to 59.5 m–2 and were more than 9 times higher on the fore reef (21.9 ± 0.8 m–2) than on the back reef (2.4 ± 0.3 m–2). The highest juvenile densities were observed in the middle of the sampled range at 14 m depth on the fore reef. Juvenile corals accounted for {\textgreater}31\% of coral colonies in all habitats and depths, which resulted in positively skewed size-frequency distributions. The microhabitat of juvenile corals on coral rubble was best described as a convex surface covered with crustose coralline algae that lacked another coral within a 20 mm radius. This study provides basic ecology and natural history information of small juvenile corals and shows the feasibility of surveying corals ≤5 mm in diameter as a method for monitoring coral populations and assessing environmental changes on a coral reef.},

Here, we illustrate how increasing frequency and severity of large scale storm events associated with global climate change may be particularly profound at the local scale for human populations that rely on lagoon systems for provision of a variety of goods and services. In August 2011 a storm originating in the Southern Ocean caused a large amplitude ocean swell to move northward through the Pacific Ocean. Its arrival at Palmyra Atoll coincided with transient elevated sea surface height and triggered turnover of the lagoon water column. This storm-induced change to the lagoon reflects long distance connectivity with propagated wave energy from the Southern Ocean and illustrates the increasing threats generated by climate change that are faced by human populations on most low-lying Pacific islands and atolls.},

In American Samoa, Clade D symbionts dominate habitats with higher maximum temperatures, while Clades C and D are both common under lower maximum temperatures.

	abstract = {The skeletons of many reef-building corals are accreted with rhythmic structural patterns that serve as valuable sclerochronometers. Annual high- and low-density band couplets, visible in X-radiographs or computed tomography scans, are used to construct age models for paleoclimate reconstructions and to track variability in coral growth over time. In some corals, discrete, anomalously high-density bands, called “stress bands,” preserve information about coral bleaching. However, the mechanisms underlying the formation of coral skeletal density banding remain unclear. Dissepiments—thin, horizontal sheets of calcium carbonate accreted by the coral to support the living polyp—play a key role in the upward growth of the colony. Here, we first conducted a vital staining experiment to test whether dissepiments were accreted with lunar periodicity in Porites coral skeleton, as previously hypothesized. Over 6, 15, and 21 months, dissepiments consistently formed in a 1:1 ratio to the number of full moons elapsed over each study period. We measured dissepiment spacing to reconstruct multiple years of monthly skeletal extension rates in two Porites colonies from Palmyra Atoll and in another from Palau that bleached in 1998 under anomalously high sea temperatures. Spacing between successive dissepiments exhibited strong seasonality in corals containing annual density bands, with narrow (wide) spacing associated with high (low) density, respectively. A high-density “stress band” accreted during the 1998 bleaching event was associated with anomalously low dissepiment spacing and missed dissepiments, implying that thermal stress disrupts skeletal extension. Further, uranium/calcium ratios increased within stress bands, indicating a reduction in the carbonate ion concentration of the coral’s calcifying fluid under stress. Our study verifies the lunar periodicity of dissepiments, provides a mechanistic basis for the formation of annual density bands in Porites, and reveals the underlying cause of high-density stress bands.},

Single species acoustic behavior during daytime observations was recorded with a towed hydrophone array sampling at 192 and 480 kHz. Additionally, an autonomous, bottom moored High-frequency Acoustic Recording Package (HARP) collected acoustic data with a sampling rate of 200 kHz. Melon-headed whale echolocation clicks had the lowest peak and center frequencies, spinner dolphins had the highest frequencies and bottlenose dolphins were nested in between these two species. Frequency differences were significant. Temporal parameters were not well suited for classification. Feature differences were enhanced by reducing variability within a set of single clicks by calculating mean spectra for groups of clicks. Median peak frequencies of averaged clicks (group size 50) of melon-headed whales ranged between 24.4 and 29.7 kHz, of bottlenose dolphins between 26.7 and 36.7 kHz, and of spinner dolphins between 33.8 and 36.0 kHz.

This study experimentally (1) examined species-specific responses to seabird guano gradients, (2) considered the role that differential functional traits among species play in altering plant response to guano, and (3) investigated the implications of seabird guano on range-expanding species. • Methods: Using a greenhouse fertilization experiment, we examined how guano fertilization affects the growth and functional traits of four tree species dominant in the Pacific Islands: Cocos nucifera, Pisonia grandis, Scaevola sericea, and Tournefortia argentea. In these systems, seabirds are frequently found in association with three of these four species; the remaining species, C. nucifera, is a recently proliferating species commonly found in the region but rarely associated with seabirds. • Key results: We determined that responses to guano addition differed significantly between species in ways that were consistent with predictions based on differing functional traits among species. Notably, we demonstrated that C. nucifera showed no growth responses to guano additions, whereas all seabird-associated plants showed strong responses. • Conclusions: These results provide experimental evidence of differential species response to guano additions, suggesting that differences in species functional traits may contribute to changes in plant communities in seabird-dominated areas, with seabird-associated species garnering performance advantages in these high-nutrient environments. Among these species, results also suggest that C. nucifera may have a competitive advantage in low-nutrient environments, providing an unusual example of how a range-expanding plant species can profit from low-nutrient environments.},

Here, the results are presented of a taxonomic survey of the digenean metacercariae of fishes from Palmyra Atoll, a remote and relatively pristine US National Wildlife Refuge located 1680 km SSW of Hawaii. Up to 425 individual fish were collected, comprising 42 fish species, from the sand flats bordering the lagoon of the atoll. Quantitative parasitological examinations of each fish were performed. Morphological descriptions of the encountered digenean metacercariae are provided, together with their prevalence, mean intensities, host and tissue-use. Up to 33,964 individuals were recovered representing 19 digenean metacercaria species from eight families. The species composition of digeneans in lagoon fishes at Palmyra Atoll is a subset of what has previously been reported for the EIP. Further, the large diversity and abundance of metacercariae reported in this study highlight the utility of including this group in future ecological research in the EIP marine ecoregion.},

	abstract = {High densities of palms are common in many tropical forests. In some cases, the dominance of palms has been associated with a depauperate understorey and high rates of native seedling mortality. A variety of different potential mechanisms has been suggested to explain the sustained palm dominance in the understorey and canopy of these forests. Working in a Cocos nucifera-dominated wet tropical forest at Palmyra Atoll in the central Pacific, we examine how litterfall from this pantropical, and economically important palm, impacts seedling survival. We compare rates of litterfall, and rates of litterfall-associated damage, between forest stands dominated by C. nucifera (coconut palm) and forest stands with low abundance of C. nucifera. To assess litterfall damage we survey damage to both artificial seedlings (n = 711), outplanted real seedlings of two species (with and without protection via caging; n = 204), and standing rates of litterfall damage. We find that rates of large-litterfall damage were an average of five times higher in sites with high densities of C. nucifera. Associated with these increases we observe that levels of physical damage to artificial model seedlings caused by litterfall over a 4-mo period increased from 4.9\% in sites with low abundance of C. nucifera to 16.1\% in sites with high abundance of C. nucifera. Extrapolated to annual rates, litterfall damage of this magnitude exceeds the average levels observed in other published studies. Living native seedlings also showed more than 300\% higher levels of mortality in forest stands with high densities of C. nucifera, a difference that was greatly reduced when protected by caging from litterfall. In contrast, uncaged C. nucifera seedlings actually had slightly higher survivorship in habitats dominated by conspecifics. We suggest that litterfall damage may be an important mechanism by which this tropical palm reaches and maintains near monodominance in many coastal and insular habitats.},

We deployed spatial arrays of autonomous sensors across distinct shallow coral reef habitats to determine patterns of spatiotemporal variability in seawater physicochemical parameters. Temperature and pH were positively correlated over the course of a day due to solar heating and light-driven metabolism. The mean temporal and spatial ranges of temperature and pH were positively correlated across all sites, with different regimes of variability observed in different reef types. Ultimately, depth was a reliable predictor of the average diel ranges in both seawater temperature and pH. These results demonstrate that there is widespread environmental variability on diel timescales within coral reefs related to water column depth, which needs to be included in assessments of how global change will locally affect reef ecosystems.},

Our characterization spans several coincident gradients (in human habitation and exploitation, latitude, and nutrient upwelling) from uninhabited, presently unfished, and oligotrophic Kingman to relatively densely populated, fished, and equatorially upwelled Kiritimati. Major findings are most consistent with direct effects of extraction on large-bodied predators and indirect effects on lower-level assemblage structure. Fish assemblages at Palmyra and especially Kingman atolls were characterized by high total standing biomass, large average body sizes, a preponderance of apex predators and other piscivorous fishes in an inverted biomass pyramid, few and small planktivorous fishes, and herbivores dominated by non-territorial species. Median body sizes at color change from initial to terminal phase (an index of sex change in parrotfishes) were also small for 4 species of parrotfish at Kingman and Palmyra. Fish assemblages at Tabuaeran and especially Kiritimati atolls had starkly contrasting characteristics: piscivorous and other fisheries-targeted fishes were depauperate, lower-trophic levels dominated fish biomass, planktivorous fishes were larger-bodied and more numerous, territorial herbivores were better represented, and size at maturation in parrotfishes was proportionately larger. Our results show the effects that even modest fishing effort can have on assemblage structure and indicate the importance of reefs like Kingman as increasingly rare relicts of natural coral reefs, providing insights into the natural structure and function of these ecosystems.},

We documented high resolution temporal patterns in temperature and pH from three reefs in the central Pacific and examined how these data relate to community development and net accretion rates of early successional benthic organisms. These reefs experienced substantial diel fluctuations in temperature (0.78°C) and pH ({\textgreater}0.2) similar to the magnitude of ‘warming’ and ‘acidification’ expected over the next century. Where daily pH within the benthic boundary layer failed to exceed pelagic climatological seasonal lows, net accretion was slower and fleshy, non-calcifying benthic organisms dominated space.

	abstract = {Cryptic species are widespread across the phylum Porifera making the identification of non-indigenous species difficult, an issue not easily resolved by the use of morphological characteristics. The widespread order Haplosclerida is a prime example due to limited and plastic morphological features. Here, we study the reported introduction of Haliclona (Soestella) caerulea from the Caribbean to Palmyra Atoll via Hawaiʻi using morphological characteristics and genetic analyses based on one nuclear (18s rDNA) and three mitochondrial (COI, the barcoding COI extension (COI ext.) and rnl rDNA) markers. Despite no clear division in lengths of the oxea spicules between the samples, both mtDNA and nDNA phylogenetic trees supported similar topologies resolving two distinct clades. Across the two clades, the concatenated mtDNA tree resolved twelve subclades, with the COI ext. yielding most of the variability between the samples. Low sequence divergence values (0.68\%) between two of the subclades indicate that the same species is likely to occur at Palmyra, Hawaiʻi and the Caribbean, supporting the hypothesis that H. caerulea was introduced to Palmyra from the Caribbean, although whether species came directly from the Caribbean to Palmyra or from Hawaiʻi remains unresolved. Conversely, the pattern of highly divergent cryptic species supports the notion that traditionally used spicule measurements are taxonomically unreliable in this group. This study illustrates how understanding the scale of within- as opposed to between-species level genetic variation is critical for interpreting biogeographic patterns and inferring the origins of introduced organisms.},

	abstract = {It is challenging to assess long-term trends in mobile, long-lived and relatively rare species such as sharks. Despite ongoing declines in many coastal shark populations, conventional surveys might be too fleeting and too recent to describe population trends over decades to millennia. Placing recent shark declines into historical context should improve management efforts as well as our understanding of past ecosystem dynamics. A new palaeoecological approach for surveying shark abundance on coral reefs is to quantify dermal denticle assemblages preserved in sediments. This approach assumes that denticle accumulation rates correlate with shark abundances. Here, we test this assumption by comparing the denticle record in surface sediments to three conventional shark survey methods at Palmyra Atoll, Line Islands, central Pacific Ocean, where shark density is high and spatially heterogeneous. We generally found a significant positive correlation between denticle accumulation rates and shark abundances derived from underwater visual census, baited remote underwater video and hook and line surveys. Denticle accumulation rates reflected shark abundances, suggesting that denticle assemblages can preserve a signal of time-averaged shark abundance in low-energy coral reef environments. We offer suggestions for applying this tool to measure shark abundance over long time-scales in other contexts.},

Here, we reconstructed the inter-annual variability in central equatorial Pacific surface water ∆14C from 1922–1956 using near-monthly 14C measurements in a Porites sp. coral skeleton (FI5A) from the windward side of Fanning Island (3°54′32′′N, 159°18'88′′W). The most pronounced feature in this record is a large, positive shift in the ∆14C between 1947 and 1956 that coincides with the switch of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) from a positive to a negative phase in the mid-1940s. Although the absolute ∆14C values from 1950–1955 in FI5A differ from the ∆14C values of another coral core collected from the opposite side of the island, both records show a large, positive shift in their ∆14C records at that time. The relative increase in the ∆14C of each record is consistent with the premise that a common mechanism is controlling the ∆14C records within each coral record. Overall, the Fanning ∆14C data support the notion that a significant amount of subtropical seawater is arriving at the Equator, but does not allow us to determine the mechanism for its transport.},

	abstract = {The prevalence of coral bleaching due to thermal stress has been increasing on coral reefs worldwide. While many studies have documented how corals respond to warming, fewer have focused on benthic community responses over longer time periods or on the response of non-coral taxa (e.g., crustose coralline algae, macroalgae, or turf). Here, we quantify spatial and temporal changes in benthic community composition over a decade using image analysis of permanent photoquadrats on Palmyra Atoll in the central Pacific Ocean. Eighty permanent plots were photographed annually between 2009 and 2018 on both the wave-exposed fore reef (FR, 10 m depth, n = 4 sites) and the wave-sheltered reef terrace (RT, 5 m depth, n = 4 sites) habitats. The El Niño events of 2009–2010 and 2015–2016 resulted in acute thermal stress and coral bleaching was observed at both reef habitats during these events. Across 10 yr and two bleaching events, the benthic community structure on Palmyra shows evidence of long-term stability. Communities on the RT exhibited minimal change in percent cover of the dominant functional groups, while the FR had greater variability and minor declines in hard coral cover. There was also spatial variation in the trajectory of each site through time. Coral cover decreased at some sites 1 yr following both bleaching events and was replaced by different algal groups depending on the site, yet returned to pre-bleaching levels within 2 yr. Overall, our data reveal the resilience of calcifier-dominated coral reef communities on Palmyra Atoll that have persisted over the last decade despite two bleaching events, demonstrating the capacity for these reefs to recover from and/or withstand disturbances in the absence of local stressors.},

	abstract = {Coral reefs are simultaneously the most biodiverse, arguably most valuable, and most vulnerable to climate change type of marine ecosystem. Reefs provide many ecosystem services, such as food, income, protection from storm surge and sea level rise, and yet coral reefs are at high risk of negative impacts due to climate change. In order to understand climate change vulnerability in reef ecosystems and the factors which could confer or preclude resilience, we need to examine and have a thorough grasp of reef environmental variability on different time scales when it comes to temperature and carbon chemistry specifically, and particularly the biological and physical drivers of such variability. This dissertation addresses both aspects of climate change threats to coral reefs: rise in sea surface temperatures (SSTs) as well as the dynamics of declining pH associated with changes to the carbon system with continued ocean acidification (OA). The former is examined through a methodological paper on improved projections of coral bleaching for reef globally based on global climate models, and the latter is addressed via three thorough field studies of carbon budgets and reef metabolism on three different reefs spanning the Western Pacific, Central Equatorial Pacific, and a high-latitude Great Barrier Reef.
This dissertation offers valuable information towards the following advances: 1) progress in instrumentation which can accurately and autonomously produce high-resolution datasets of environmental variability in different reef habitat types; 2) refinement of methodologies for computing reef metabolism as well as reef sensitivity to temperature and pH stress; and 3) an improved mechanistic understanding of physical, biological, and ecological drivers of coastal carbon dynamics and their implications for conditioning reefs for the future.
Specifically, this dissertation demonstrates our ability to improve future projections for thermal stress on reefs and threats from bleaching significantly depend on using global climate model output of high spatial resolution and applying a refined methodology aimed at incorporating internal temperature variability as part of the exposure to thermal stress metric. The spatial patterns in bleaching probabilities presented here and in other subsequent studies on the topic may provide insights into conservation priorities of particularly thermally resilient reef locations.
In addition, perhaps the most important lesson learned from field measurements and interdisciplinary studies on reef carbon budgets presented in this dissertation is that there is rarely a one-size-fits-all type of approach that could yield robust and accurate reef metabolism estimates. Reef systems are more complex than we have previously considered, and their conditioning to environmental variability is actually based on complex feedbacks between ecological community composition and various physiological processes, which leave their mark on the overlying ambient seawater. Environmental variability and thus conditioning and the potential to resist or be resilient to future ocean acidification are all characteristics strongly modulated by the interactions between reef metabolism and hydrodynamic regimes and highlight the need to continued field monitoring aimed at high-resolution characterization of both carbon chemistry and hydrodynamics. This dissertation contributes a detailed understanding of the challenges involved in investigating reef biogeochemistry and water circulation in reef habitats in relation to reef net community calcification (NCC) and net community production (NCP) (collectively referred to as reef metabolism).},

	abstract = {Despite the abundance of research on coral reef change detection, few studies have been conducted to assess the spatial generalization principles of a live coral cover classifier trained using remote sensing data from multiple locations. The aim of this study is to develop a machine learning classifier for coral dominated benthic cover-type class (CDBCTC) based on ground truth observations and Landsat images, evaluate the performance of this classifier when tested against new data, then deploy the classifier to perform CDBCTC change analysis of multiple locations. The proposed framework includes image calibration, support vector machine (SVM) training and tuning, statistical assessment of model accuracy, and temporal pixel-based image differencing. Validation of the methodology was performed by cross-validation and train/test split using ground truth observations of benthic cover from four different reefs. These four locations (Palmyra Atoll, Kingman Reef, Baker Island Atoll, and Howland Island) as well as two additional locations (Kiritimati Island and Tabuaeran Island) were then evaluated for CDBCTC change detection. The in-situ training accuracy against ground truth observations for Palmyra Atoll, Kingman Reef, Baker Island Atoll, and Howland Island were 87.9\%, 85.7\%, 69.2\%, and 82.1\% respectively. The classifier attained generalized accuracy scores of 78.8\%, 81.0\%, 65.4\%, and 67.9\% for the respective locations when trained using ground truth observations from neighboring reefs and tested against the local ground truth observations of each reef. The classifier was trained using the consolidated ground truth data of all four sites and attained a cross-validated accuracy of 75.3\%. The CDBCTC change detection analysis showed a decrease in CDBCTC of 32\% at Palmyra Atoll, 25\% at Kingman Reef, 40\% at Baker Island Atoll, 25\% at Howland Island, 35\% at Tabuaeran Island, and 43\% at Kiritimati Island. This research establishes a methodology for developing a robust classifier and the associated Controlled Parameter Cross-Validation (CPCV) process for evaluating how well the model will generalize to new data. It is an important step for improving the scientific understanding of temporal change within coral reefs around the globe.},

The monotypic Crebradomus gen. nov., based on C. gongylocarpus sp. nov., is restricted to Lord Howe Island in the southern Australasian-Pacific Ocean. Dissimularia gen. nov. consists of the type species, D. dactylocarpa sp. nov., from its Lord Howe Island type locality, as well as from the Hawaiian Islands, Guam and possibly Burma and the southern Great Barrier Reef, plus three geographically restricted, virtually cryptic species from small islands or atolls in Samoa and Micronesia. The long-problematical ‘Cryptonemia? umbraticola’ is shown on the basis of molecular studies of recent collections from its type locality, remote Palmyra Atoll, to represent a distinct species of Dissimularia, D. umbraticola comb. nov., with D. tauensis sp. nov. and D. withallii sp. nov. from Tau and Jarvis Islands, respectively, also belonging to this complex. Morphological features common to these taxa included turf-like, often imbricate thin blades of irregular contour, thalli that tended to occupy shaded habitats on coral reefs between 1.5- and 40-m depths, and blade sections that consisted of a shallow anticlinal cortex and a broad, lax to densely compact medulla of mostly periclinal filaments interspersed with varying numbers of anticlinally and obliquely traversing filaments. Only Crebredomus was found cystocarpic, the carposporophytes densely aggregated in verrucose marginal pods and consisting of a lengthy narrow fusion cell of irregular contours and a candelabra-shaped distal cluster of gonimoblast filaments bearing terminal chains of two or three carposporangia beneath a narrow ostiole. Male gametophytes and tetrasporophytes remain unknown in both genera.

High-resolution bathymetric data combined with in situ oceanographic measurements and a nearshore hydrodynamic model revealed complex intra-atoll gradients in geomorphic complexity, wave forcing, currents, and temperature. For example, maximum wave-driven bed shear stress spatially varied on the forereef (15-20 m depth) by over 2 orders of magnitude, peaking in areas exposed to multiple wave regimes. Benthic community composition, quantified via towed-diver imagery collected in a complete circumnavigation of the atoll ({\textasciitilde}40 km), also exhibited considerable spatial heterogeneity. Benthic competitors showed distinct, non-linear threshold-type responses to variations in physical drivers. For example, at a wave-driven bed shear stress threshold of 18 N m-2, calcifying crustose coralline algae lost relative dominance and were replaced by non-calcifying fleshy turf algae. Hard coral communities also demonstrated considerable flexibility in response to physical drivers, with distinct shifts in the relative dominance of different growth morphologies along gradients of wave forcing, presumably as a means of local adaptation. Our results highlight (1) the importance of natural gradients in physical drivers in determining dominant benthic regimes on coral reefs (e.g. calcifying vs. fleshy), (2) that non-linear thresholds (or tipping points) exist between key benthic competitors in response to key physical drivers, and (3) that coral assemblages show inherent flexibility and can reorganize in response to physical drivers rather than exhibit wholesale changes in overall cover.},

	abstract = {The relationship between decadal to centennial changes in ocean circulation and climate is difficult to discern using the sparse and discontinuous instrumental record of climate and, as such, represents a large uncertainty in coupled ocean-atmosphere general circulation models. We present new modern and fossil coral radiocarbon (Δ14C) records from Palmyra (6°N, 162°W) and Christmas (2°N, 157°W) islands to constrain central tropical Pacific ocean circulation changes during the last millennium. Seasonally to annually resolved coral Δ14C measurements from the 10th, 12th–17th, and 20th centuries do not contain significant interannual to decadal-scale variations, despite large changes in coral δ18O on these timescales. A centennial-scale increase in coral radiocarbon from the Medieval Climate Anomaly (∼900–1200 AD) to the Little Ice Age (∼1500–1800) can be largely explained by changes in the atmospheric Δ14C, as determined with a box model of Palmyra mixed layer Δ14C. However, large 12th century depletions in Palmyra coral Δ14C may reflect as much as a 100\% increase in upwelling rates and/or a significant decrease in the Δ14C of higher-latitude source waters reaching the equatorial Pacific during this time. SEM photos reveal evidence for minor dissolution and addition of secondary aragonite in the fossil corals, but our results suggest that coral Δ14C is only compromised after moderate to severe diagenesis for these relatively young fossil corals.},

	abstract = {Competition for space is a major factor affecting coral survival. Since adult coral colonies are sessile, the settlement preferences of larvae have a strong impact on the competition for space that corals will face post-metamorphosis and will therefore influence long-term survival. Laboratory-based studies show that in simplified systems coral larvae use cues to guide them to suitable settlement locations, an adaptation that enhances post-settlement survival. Settlement preferences have also been reported from the field, where coral larvae encounter a wide variety of different potential settlement surfaces as the availability of free substratum (bare space) changes over time. In this field-based study, the abundance of different encrusting organisms and bare space present on settlement tiles was compared to their abundance under newly settled pocilloporid and poritid recruits, to determine if recruits choose their settlement substratum randomly. Tiles deployed for 3, 9, 12 and 15 months were used to determine if settlement choice varied as a function of benthic community successional stage. We found that pocilloporid and poritid larvae changed their settlement preference depending on the age of the benthic community they encountered. They reacted neutrally to crustose coralline algae (CCA) on tiles deployed for 3 months when bare space was abundant, but showed a clear preference for settlement on CCA on tiles deployed for 9–15 months once bare space was limited. Simultaneously, poritid recruits showed a decreasing preference over time to settle on biofilm. This change in preference is not linked to the availability of CCA because its abundance did not change significantly between tiles deployed for 3 versus 9–15 months. These results indicate that coral recruits react to several settlement cues simultaneously, guiding them to different settlement locations as the benthos changes over time. Furthermore, recruits from both families reacted similarly, suggesting that this is an evolutionarily old adaption.},

	abstract = {Growth anomalies (GAs) in scleractinian corals drain energy from the host and can result in partial or entire colony mortality. Here I show that growth anomaly removal is an effective treatment for the branching coral Acropora acuminata, with 90\% of subjects remaining GA-free 9 mo following the procedure. In contrast, the encrusting coral Montipora efflorescens did not respond positively to treatment, with GAs re-developing in 100\% of treated subjects. There was no clear evidence that injuries sustained during GA removal increased susceptibility to GA development in either coral species. Based on these results, I hypothesize that the factors inducing GAs in Acropora acuminata are localized, whereas those in Montipora efflorescens appear more systemic throughout the colony—perhaps the result of a genetically-based factor, or a persistent causative agent such as a virus. GA removal may therefore be effective for targeted rescues of particular coral species and morphologies in reef systems with low overall disease prevalence and is likely to be most effective for scleractinian corals if complimented by management actions that address the ultimate drivers of GAs on coral reefs.},

	title = {Coral {Disease} and the {Environment} in the {Pacific} {Ocean}},
	url = {http://researcharchive.vuw.ac.nz/handle/10063/1564},
	abstract = {Coral diseases are a major threat to coral reef health and functioning worldwide. Little is 
known about how coral disease prevalence relates to multiple interacting changes in host 
densities, abiotic stressors, and levels of human impact. In particular, almost nothing is 
known about coral disease dynamics under changing abiotic conditions in the absence of 
direct anthropogenic stressors. Understanding how disease dynamics change relative to shifts 
in environmental conditions is crucial for the successful management and future survival of 
coral reefs. With the use of existing and novel field data and statistical modeling I examined 
the associations (abiotic and biotic) of multiple coral disease states across a variety of spatial 
scales encompassing a wide range of environmental conditions. Biomedical techniques were 
then used to relate these environmental associations to potential disease etiology. Study sites 
included areas with high levels of anthropogenic impact (e.g. Oahu, main Hawaiian Islands); 
to extremely remote quasi-pristine reefs removed from direct human influence (e.g. Palmyra 
Atoll National Wildlife Refuge). 
Over small spatial scales (100s m) at a marine reserve in the main Hawaiian Islands I 
modelled the spatial patterns of four coral diseases (Porites growth anomalies, Porites tissue 
loss, Porites trematodiasis and Montipora white syndrome). While Porites tissue loss and 
Montipora white syndrome were positively associated with poor environmental conditions 
(poor water quality, low coral cover), Porites growth anomalies and Porites trematodiasis 
were more prevalent in areas considered to be of superior quality (clearer water, increased 
host abundance, higher numbers of fish). At Palmyra Atoll, fatal tissue loss diseases were 
largely absent and although coral growth anomalies were present their prevalence was 
extremely low. Patterns of growth anomaly prevalence at Palmyra were positively associated 
with host abundance across four coral genera (Acropora, Astreopora, Montipora and Porites) 
and generally negatively associated with algal cover. Growth anomalies, although progressive 
and detrimental to the hosts, were most prevalent in the "healthiest" regions (the highest coral 
cover regions) of Palmyra. I hypothesised that differences seen in the types and prevalence of 
coral diseases between heavily populated parts of Hawaii and remote uninhabited locations 
such as Palmyra Atoll, could be a result of differing levels of either direct (e.g. pollution) or 
indirect (e.g. pollution leading to loss of key hosts) human stressors, in addition to natural 
changes in the environment. 
To begin disentangling the confounding effects of natural variability and human stressors on 
coral disease prevalence patterns I modelled two diseases (Acropora and Porites growth 
anomalies) across hundreds of sites throughout the Indo-Pacific Ocean (1000s km). 
Predictors included host densities, human population numbers, frequency of sea surface 
temperature anomalies, and input of ultra-violet radiation. Porites growth anomaly 
prevalence was positively associated with human population density (and to a lesser extent 
host density), while the prevalence of Acropora growth anomalies was strongly host density 
dependent. The positive association between the prevalence of Porites growth anomalies and 
human density suggests the presence and prevalence of the disease are related, directly or 
indirectly, to some environmental co-factor associated with increased human density at 
regional spatial scales. Although this association has been widely posited, this is one of the 
first wide scale studies unambiguously linking a coral disease with human population size. 
In summary, the types of coral diseases observed, their prevalence, and spatial patterns of 
distribution within reef systems are the result of multiple abiotic and biotic factors and 
stressors interacting, in some cases synergistically. Statistical modelling, in conjunction with 
biomedical techniques and field observations, proved essential to the understanding of coral 
disease ecology within single reefs and atolls to patterns across entire oceans.},

	abstract = {Despite the heightened awareness of ocean acidification (OA) effects on marine organisms, few studies empirically juxtapose biological responses to CO2 manipulations across functionally distinct primary producers, particularly benthic algae. Algal responses to OA may vary because increasing CO2 has the potential to fertilize photosynthesis but impair biomineralization. Using a series of repeated experiments on Palmyra Atoll, simulated OA effects were tested across a suite of ecologically important coral reef algae, including five fleshy and six calcareous species. Growth, calcification and photophysiology were measured for each species independently and metrics were combined from each experiment using a meta-analysis to examine overall trends across functional groups categorized as fleshy, upright calcareous, and crustose coralline algae (CCA). The magnitude of the effect of OA on algal growth response varied by species, but the direction was consistent within functional groups. Exposure to OA conditions generally enhanced growth in fleshy macroalgae, reduced net calcification in upright calcareous algae, and caused net dissolution in CCA. Additionally, three of the five fleshy seaweeds tested became reproductive upon exposure to OA conditions. There was no consistent effect of OA on algal photophysiology. Our study provides experimental evidence to support the hypothesis that OA will reduce the ability of calcareous algae to biomineralize. Further, we show that CO2 enrichment either will stimulate population or somatic growth in some species of fleshy macroalgae. Thus, our results suggest that projected OA conditions may favor non-calcifying algae and influence the relative dominance of fleshy macroalgae on reefs, perpetuating or exacerbating existing shifts in reef community structure.},

	abstract = {Positive density-dependent seed and seedling predation, where herbivores selectively eat seeds or seedlings of common species, is thought to play a major role in creating and maintaining plant community diversity. However, many herbivores and seed predators are known to exhibit preferences for rare foods, which could lead to negative density-dependent predation. In this study, we first demonstrate the occurrence of increased predation of locally rare tree species by a widespread group of insular seed and seedling predators, land crabs. We then build computer simulations based on these empirical data to examine the effects of such predation on diversity patterns. Simulations show that herbivore preferences for locally rare species are likely to drive scale-dependent effects on plant community diversity: at small scales these foraging patterns decrease plant community diversity via the selective consumption of rare plant species, while at the landscape level they should increase diversity, at least for short periods, by promoting clustered local dominance of a variety of species. Finally, we compared observed patterns of plant diversity at the site to those obtained via computer simulations, and found that diversity patterns generated under simulations were highly consistent with observed diversity patterns. We posit that preference for rare species by herbivores may be prevalent in low- or moderate-diversity systems, and that these effects may help explain diversity patterns across different spatial scales in such ecosystems.},

We discuss how five commonly used approaches for conservation (buy and protect conservation; conservation motivated by the intrinsic values of nature; ecosystem service based conservation; ecotourism driven conservation; and conservation enabled by community planning) can be optimally applied to protect ecosystems in these special settings. In this discussion we draw examples from two model remote sites: Palmyra and Tabuaeran Atolls. Spatial analyses conducted using population density as a proxy for remoteness indicate that many existing recognized protected areas already include remote regions, but that the vast majority of the overall remote zones on the planet are not yet formally protected. Initiating discussions that directly consider both the roadblocks and opportunities for conservation in remote areas will help increase our odds of successfully protecting biodiversity in these unique and strategically important contexts.},

	abstract = {Bolbometopon muricatum are ecologically unique mega-consumers in coral reef ecosystems. They primarily divide their dietary intake between living scleractinian corals and coral rock, a substrate richly colonized by non-coral biota. Here we examine how the chemical, structural, and energetic content of these two main classes of forage material may influence B. muricatum feeding behavior and selectivity. We then also examine nutrient content, pH, and alkalinity of the carbonate-rich feces of B. muricatum as a step toward understanding how B. muricatum defecation could affect reef nutrient dynamics and localized seawater chemistry. Our results suggest that by most measures, coral rock constitutes a richer food source than living corals, exhibiting higher levels of eight biologically relevant elements, and containing approximately three times greater caloric value than living corals. Additionally, the two forage types also presented distinct mineralogy, with the coral rock resembling a Mg-enriched carbonate phase in contrast to the primarily aragonitic live corals. Despite the fact that individual B. muricatum excrete tons of macerated coral annually, the low measured concentrations of N and P in feces suggest that this excretion may have relatively minor effects of reef macronutrient budgets. We also observed negligible local-scale impacts of B. muricatum feces on seawater pH and alkalinity. The approaches applied here integrate perspectives from marine biogeochemistry, materials science, and ecology. Collectively, these results provide preliminary insight into how reef chemistry could shape foraging of this dominant and vulnerable coral reef consumer and how it, in turn, might affect the chemistry of these reefs.},

Genetic species delimitation methods provide a standardized means for taxonomic classification including of cryptic, rare, or elusive groups, but results can vary by analytical method and genetic marker. In this study, a combination of morphological and genetic identification methods was used to estimate species richness and identify taxonomic units in true crabs (Infraorder Brachyura; n = 200) from coral reefs of Palmyra Atoll, Central Pacific. Genetic identification was based on matches between mitochondrial 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) and/or cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) sequences to GenBank data, while morphological work relied on the taxonomic literature. Broad agreement in the number of candidate species delimited by genetic distance thresholds and tree-based approaches was found, although the multi-rate Poisson tree process (mPTP) was less appropriate for this dataset. The COI sequence data identified 30–32 provisional species and the 16S data revealed 34–35. The occurrence of 10 families, 20 genera, and 19 species of brachyurans at Palmyra was corroborated by at least two methods. Diversity levels within Chlorodiella laevissima indicated possible undescribed or cryptic species in currently lumped taxa. These results illustrate the efficacy of DNA sequences in identifying organisms and detecting cryptic variation, and underscore the importance of using appropriate genetic markers and multiple species delimitation analyses, with applications for future species descriptions.},

	abstract = {Reconstructions of the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) are often created using the oxygen isotopic ratio in tropical coral skeletons (δ18O). However, coral δ18O can be difficult to interpret quantitatively, as it reflects changes in both temperature and the δ18O value of seawater. Small-scale (10–100 km) processes affecting local temperature and seawater δ18O are also poorly quantified and contribute an unknown amount to intercoral δ18O offsets. A new version of the Regional Ocean Modeling System capable of directly simulating seawater δ18O (isoROMS) is therefore presented to address these issues. The model is used to simulate δ18O variations over the 1979–2009 period throughout the Pacific at coarse (O(50 km)) resolution, in addition to 10 km downscaling experiments covering the central equatorial Pacific Line Islands, a preferred site for paleo-ENSO reconstruction from corals. A major impact of downscaling at the Line Islands is the ability to resolve fronts associated with tropical instability waves (TIWs), which generate large excursions in both temperature and seawater δ18O at Palmyra Atoll (5.9°N, 162.1°W). TIW-related sea surface temperature gradients are smaller at neighboring Christmas Island (1.9°N, 157.5°W), but the interaction of mesoscale features with the steep island topography nonetheless generates cross-island temperature differences of up to 1°C. These nonlinear processes alter the slope of the salinity:seawater δ18O relationship at Palmyra and Christmas, as well as affect the relation between coral δ18O and indices of ENSO variability. Consideration of the full physical oceanographic context of reef environments is therefore crucial for improving δ18O-based ENSO reconstructions.},

	abstract = {Few studies have documented the spatial and temporal dynamics of highly invasive species in coral reef benthic communities. Here, we quantified the ecological dynamics of invasion by a corallimorph, Rhodactis howesii, at Palmyra Atoll in the central Pacific. A localized outbreak of this species was first observed following a shipwreck at Palmyra in 1991 and has subsequently spread across hectares, reaching 100\% cover in some areas. We examined the spatial and temporal dynamics of this invasion, and its impact on the benthic community, using a combination of permanent photoquadrats and large-scale photomosaic imagery. Our data revealed two distinct patterns in the spatial dynamics of R. howesii on the reef. First, following the removal of the shipwreck in 2013, the cover of the corallimorph in the immediate vicinity of the wreck decreased markedly, with crustose coralline algae (CCA), an important reef-builder, dominating the newly available substrate. However, in contrast to the decline at the epicenter of the invasion, the corallimorph has spread to additional sites around the atoll where increases in abundance have been associated with decreases in hard coral cover. Reductions in percent cover and corallimorph patch size near the epicenter of the outbreak, coupled with increases in cover and patch size and appearance of the corallimorph at other locations around Palmyra, demonstrate the dynamic nature of this “invasion.” Further, we found that the corallimorph settled disproportionately often on patches of turf or CCA cover, but can then overgrow all benthic competitors following establishment. This study provides evidence that R. howesii has the capacity to be highly invasive on coral reefs and highlights the importance of large-scale, long-term monitoring efforts to capture the dynamic nature of such invasions.},

Most turtles died from fishing-induced or boat strike trauma followed by infectious/inflammatory diseases, nutritional problems (mainly cachexia), and an array of physiologic problems. Infectious/inflammatory problems included bacterial diseases of the lungs, eyes, liver or intestines, spirorchid fluke infection, or polyarthritis of unknown origin. Likelihood of a successful diagnosis of cause of death was a function of post-mortem decomposition. Fibropapillomatosis was not seen in turtles submitted from outside Hawaii. The preponderance of anthropogenic causes of mortality offers some management opportunities to mitigate causes of death in these animals by, for example, implementing measures to decrease boating and fishing interactions.},

	abstract = {Fishing in marine systems is analogous to a large-scale, long-term, uncontrolled ‘natural experiment’ through which pathways of ecological change can be observed. Fishing has long affected marine systems globally but has intensified drastically in recent decades. Although direct impacts of fishing - such as population declines of harvested species - are well-documented, the indirect, ecosystem-level consequences of fishing are poorly understood. Similarly, we have little empirical evidence to suggest whether pathways of recovery will mirror those of decline, or rather whether they may instead exhibit ecological hysteresis. Most studies examining indirect effects of marine fisheries focus on density-mediated trophic cascades, where removal of predators alternately drives increases and decreases in abundances of lower trophic levels. This simple expectation, while commonly observed, is not found everywhere. This incongruence suggests that the effects of fishing can take alternative pathways through ecosystems. This thesis examines populations of fishes over a large gradient of human population density, including a nearly pristine coral reef foodweb and a series of paired reefs in and outside of marine reserves spanning two biogeographic regions, show that fishing indirectly drives behavioral responses in foraging patterns across multiple prey taxa by reducing predation risk. Likewise, these small-scale behavioral responses by prey to predation risk can modify community structure. These responses can potentially have far greater net impacts (occurring simultaneously over entire assemblages) and operate over far shorter temporal scales (with potentially instantaneous response times) in transmitting top-down effects than numerical effects alone. The results of these studies demonstrate that fishing has the potential to invoke behaviorally-mediated trophic cascades in natural reef systems, which can drive previously unsuspected reef food web alterations. This research also shows that some effects of decline and recovery following the onset and cessation of fishing, respectively, are reversible – at least under moderate fishing pressure – through this behavioral pathway. Taken together, these results suggest that traditional density-mediated trophic cascades may be less apparent than expected in coral reef systems because of compensatory behavioral responses in prey.},

	abstract = {The Line Islands are calcium carbonate coral reef platforms located in iron-poor regions of the central Pacific. Natural terrestrial run-off of iron is non-existent and aerial deposition is extremely low. However, a number of ship groundings have occurred on these atolls. The reefs surrounding the shipwreck debris are characterized by high benthic cover of turf algae, macroalgae, cyanobacterial mats and corallimorphs, as well as particulate-laden, cloudy water. These sites also have very low coral and crustose coralline algal cover and are call black reefs because of the dark-colored benthic community and reduced clarity of the overlying water column. Here we use a combination of benthic surveys, chemistry, metagenomics and microcosms to investigate if and how shipwrecks initiate and maintain black reefs. Comparative surveys show that the live coral cover was reduced from 40 to 60\% to {\textless}10\% on black reefs on Millennium, Tabuaeran and Kingman. These three sites are relatively large ({\textgreater}0.75 km2). The phase shift occurs rapidly; the Kingman black reef formed within 3 years of the ship grounding. Iron concentrations in algae tissue from the Millennium black reef site were six times higher than in algae collected from reference sites. Metagenomic sequencing of the Millennium Atoll black reef-associated microbial community was enriched in iron-associated virulence genes and known pathogens. Microcosm experiments showed that corals were killed by black reef rubble through microbial activity. Together these results demonstrate that shipwrecks and their associated iron pose significant threats to coral reefs in iron-limited regions.},

	abstract = {Depth is used often as a proxy for gradients in energetic resources on coral reefs and for predicting patterns of community energy use. With increasing depth, loss of light can lead to a reduced reliance on autotrophy and an increased reliance on heterotrophy by mixotrophic corals. However, the generality of such trophic zonation varies across contexts. By combining high-resolution oceanographic measurements with isotopic analyses (δ13C, δ15N) of multiple producer and consumer levels across depths (10–30 m) at a central Pacific oceanic atoll, we show trophic zonation in mixotrophic corals can be both present and absent within the same reef system. Deep-water internal waves that deliver cool particulate-rich waters to shallow reefs occurred across all sites (2.5–5.6 events week−1 at 30 m) but the majority of events remained depth-restricted (4.3–9.7\% recorded at 30 m propagated to 10 m). In the absence of other particulate delivery, mixotrophs increased their relative degree of heterotrophy with increasing depth. However, where relatively long-lasting downwelling events (1.4–3.3 times the duration of any other site) occurred simultaneously, mixotrophs displayed elevated and consistent degrees of heterotrophy regardless of depth. Importantly, these long-lasting surface pulses were of a lagoonal origin, an area of rich heterotrophic resource supply. Under such circumstances, we hypothesize heterotrophic resource abundance loses its direct linkage with depth and, with resources readily available at all depths, trophic zonation is no longer present. Our results show that fine-scale intra-island hydrographic regimes and hydrodynamic connectivity between reef habitats contribute to explaining the context specific nature of coral trophic depth zonation in shallow reef ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Coral reefs are some of the most diverse and productive marine ecosystems on earth.
They are also among the most threatened by human disturbance. On a local scale, many of these
systems are subject to over-fishing and land-based pollution, and on a global scale, these systems
are impacted by climate change and ocean acidification: human activities clearly influence the
structure of coral reef communities. However, before considering anthropogenic influence, it is
necessary to consider the influence of local and regional environmental forcings on these
ecosystems.
In this research, I investigate natural environmental and anthropogenic drivers of benthic
community organization in 41 coral reef ecosystems across the Pacific (14.2°S – 28.4°N,
144.8°E – 155.4°W). These systems have been the focus of a long-term, multi-disciplinary
NOAA-led monitoring effort. I present a new methodological approach to spatially constrain
environmental forcings at the scale of individual islands and atolls. The results indicate
considerable spatial heterogeneity in environmental forcings, namely sea surface temperature,
waves, chlorophyll-a concentration (a proxy for phytoplankton biomass) and irradiance. Further
examination of long-term (10-year) chlorophyll-a concentrations revealed sustained increased
phytoplankton biomass just offshore of reefs compared to surrounding oceanic waters around a
majority (91\%) of islands and atolls, providing widespread evidence of the occurrence and scale
of the “island mass effect”. Additionally, significant differences in horizontal gradients in
chlorophyll-a between island and atoll systems were observed. Variations in reef area,
bathymetric slope, geomorphic type (e.g. atoll versus island), and human population were
identified as important drivers of increased phytoplankton biomass, together explaining 77\% of
the variability observed. In order to investigate biological-physical relationships at a smaller spatial scale, I focused on one oceanic atoll with a history of minimal human influence, Palmyra
Atoll (5.8°N, 162.1°W). At intra-island scales, wave forcing and reef geomorphology were
important drivers of benthic community organization. Model performance improved when hard
coral cover was modeled in distinct morphological groups (encrusting, plating, branching),
highlighting the response of coral reef communities to extrinsic physical forcings. Superimposed
on natural variations in coral reef benthic community organization are the effects of
anthropogenic disturbance.},

We quantified standing stock and input rates to the detrital resource pool in exposed forereef and protected backreef habitats of Palmyra Atoll National Wildlife Refuge and measured the trophic structure of the overlying fish assemblage. While detrital standing stock was 1.6 times higher on the backreef than on the forereef, detrital input rates were 1.7 to 2.9 times higher on the forereef. Planktivores were the most abundant guild in the forereef habitat, and stable isotope signatures of detritus reflected a greater input from pelagic sources (i.e. depleted in 13C). In contrast, herbivores and detritivores numerically dominated the backreef habitat and detrital stable isotope signatures appeared to be predominately of benthic origin (i.e. enriched in 13C). Through total organic carbon (TOC) and nitrogen analyses we found that benthic detritus may represent a significant nutritional source. Converting total nitrogen into maximum protein estimates, we found high benthic deposition of protein (104 to 124 mg m-2 d-1) and organic carbon (184 to 190 mg m-2 d-1), but very low standing stocks of these materials (protein: 5 to 6 mg m-2, organic carbon: 46 to 63 mg m-2). While high water flow rates may explain low standing stocks of detritus in forereef habitats, the lower flow rates in backreef habitats suggest that removal of this material is via consumption by abundant roving detritivorous fishes. Our results provide support for the hypothesis that reef fish detritivory represents a significant consumer-mediated energy pathway, promoting nutrient recycling by linking many elements of a complex food web.},

	abstract = {Kingman Reef and Palmyra Atoll in the central Pacific are among the most remote coral reefs on the planet. Here we describe spatial patterns in their benthic communities across reef habitats and depths, and consider these in the context of oceanographic gradients. Benthic communities at both locations were dominated by calcifying organisms (54-86\% cover), namely hard corals (20-74\%) and crustose coralline algae (CCA) (10-36\%). While turf algae were relatively common at both locations (8-22\%), larger fleshy macroalgae were virtually absent at Kingman ({\textless}1\%) and rare at Palmyra (0.7-9.3\%). Hard coral cover was higher, but with low diversity, in more sheltered habitats such as Palmyra's backreef and Kingman's patch reefs. Almost exclusive dominance by slow-growing Porites on Kingman's patch reefs provides indirect evidence of competitive exclusion, probably late in a successional sequence. In contrast, the more exposed forereef habitats at both Kingman and Palmyra had higher coral diversity and were characterized by fast-growing corals (e.g., Acropora and Pocillopora), indicative of more dynamic environments. In general at both locations, soft coral cover increased with depth, likely reflecting increasingly efficient heterotrophic abilities. CCA and fleshy macroalgae cover decreased with depth, likely due to reduced light. Cover of other calcified macroalgae, predominantly Halimeda, increased with depth. This likely reflects the ability of many calcifying macroalgae to efficiently harvest light at deeper depths, in combination with an increased nutrient supply from upwelling promoting growth. At Palmyra, patterns of hard coral cover with depth were inconsistent, but cover peaked at mid-depths at Kingman. On Kingman's forereef, benthic community composition was strongly related to wave energy, with hard coral cover decreasing and becoming more spatially clustered with increased wave energy, likely as a result of physical damage leading to patches of coral in localized shelter. In contrast, the cover of turf algae at Kingman was positively related to wave energy, reflecting their ability to rapidly colonize newly available space. No significant patterns with wave energy were observed on Palmyra's forereef, suggesting that a more detailed model is required to study biophysical coupling there. Kingman, Palmyra, and other remote oceanic reefs provide interesting case studies to explore biophysical influences on benthic ecology and dynamics.},

However, subsequent authors argued that the nearly simultaneous entry of MHWs into Sasanhaya Bay, Rota (∼5,740 km away) made this conclusion untenable. They suggested that both sightings, and other MSs of MHWs, could be related to lunar cycles. To resolve this question, we reviewed information on the biology and behavior of MHWs and compared the two sightings to observations of MHWs around Palmyra Atoll and Nuku Hiva, French Polynesia. We also tested for a relationship between observations and MSs of MHWs with lunar cycles. MHWs near many oceanic islands rest nearshore during the day and feed offshore in deeper water at night. The MHWs at Rota exhibited normal diurnal resting behavior as seen at Palmyra and Nuku Hiva, while those at Kauai showed milling behavior typically seen prior to MS events. Thus, these events were not similar. Neither observations nor MSs of MHWs were related to lunar cycles. Our review of MHW behavior strengthens the case that MFS use played a major role in the near MS in Hanalei Bay.},

We found that top predators and reef-building organisms dominated unpopulated Kingman and Palmyra, while small planktivorous fishes and fleshy algae dominated the populated atolls of Tabuaeran and Kiritimati. Sharks and other top predators overwhelmed the fish assemblages on Kingman and Palmyra so that the biomass pyramid was inverted (top-heavy). In contrast, the biomass pyramid at Tabuaeran and Kiritimati exhibited the typical bottom-heavy pattern. Reefs without people exhibited less coral disease and greater coral recruitment relative to more inhabited reefs. Thus, protection from overfishing and pollution appears to increase the resilience of reef ecosystems to the effects of global warming.},

	abstract = {The Christmas tree hydroid Pennaria disticha is listed as one of the most common introduced species in Hawaii. Firstly reported in Kaneohe Bay (Oahu) in 1928, it is now established throughout the entire archipelago, including the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, a U.S. National Monument and World Heritage site. The Hawaiian population of P. disticha has also been reported as being the source of further introductions to Palmyra Atoll in the U.S. Line Islands. Using a phylogenetic hypothesis based on a 611 base pair fragment of the mitochondrial 16S barcoding gene, we demonstrate that P. disticha is a complex of cryptic species, rather than one species with cosmopolitan distribution. We also show that in Hawaii there are three species of Pennaria, rather than one introduced species. Two of these species share haplotypes with specimens from distant locations such as Florida and Panama and may have been introduced, possibly from the Atlantic Ocean. A third species could either represent a lineage with nearly cosmopolitan distribution, or another introduced species. Our dataset refutes the widely accepted idea that only one lineage of P. disticha is present in Hawaii. On the contrary, P. disticha in Hawaii may be the outcome of multiple independent introductions of several morphologically undistinguishable cryptic lineages. Our results uncover an unsuspected complexity within the very common hydroid P. disticha, and highlight the need for routine use of molecular tools, such as DNA barcoding, to improve the identification and recognition of non-indigenous species.},

	abstract = {Many odontocetes produce frequency modulated tonal calls known as whistles. The ability to automatically determine time × frequency tracks corresponding to these vocalizations has numerous applications including species description, identification, and density estimation. This work develops and compares two algorithms on a common corpus of nearly one hour of data collected in the Southern California Bight and at Palmyra Atoll. The corpus contains over 3000 whistles from bottlenose dolphins, long- and short-beaked common dolphins, spinner dolphins, and melon-headed whales that have been annotated by a human, and released to the Moby Sound archive. Both algorithms use a common signal processing front end to determine time × frequency peaks from a spectrogram. In the first method, a particle filter performs Bayesian filtering, estimating the contour from the noisy spectral peaks. The second method uses an adaptive polynomial prediction to connect peaks into a graph, merging graphs when they cross. Whistle contours are extracted from graphs using information from both sides of crossings. The particle filter was able to retrieve 71.5\% (recall) of the human annotated tonals with 60.8\% of the detections being valid (precision). The graph algorithm’s recall rate was 80.0\% with a precision of 76.9\%.},

	abstract = {Coral reefs are threatened worldwide, and there is a need to develop new approaches to monitor reef health under natural conditions. Because simultaneous measurements of net community production (NCP) and net community calcification (NCC) are used as important indicators of reef health, tools are needed to assess them in situ. Here we present the Benthic Ecosystem and Acidification Measurement System (BEAMS) to provide the first fully autonomous approach capable of sustained, simultaneous measurements of reef NCP and NCC under undisturbed, natural conditions on time scales ranging from tens of minutes to weeks. BEAMS combines the chemical and velocity gradient in the benthic boundary layer to quantify flux from the benthos for a variety of parameters to measure NCP and NCC. Here BEAMS was used to measure these rates from two different sites with different benthic communities on the western reef terrace at Palmyra Atoll for 2 weeks in September 2014. Measurements were made every ∼15 min. The trends in metabolic rates were consistent with the benthic communities between the two sites with one dominated by fleshy organisms and the other dominated by calcifiers (degraded and healthy reefs, respectively). This demonstrates the potential utility of BEAMS as a reef health monitoring tool. NCP and NCC were tightly coupled on time scales of minutes to days, and light was the primary driver for the variability of daily integrated metabolic rates. No correlation between CO2 levels and daily integrated NCC was observed, indicating that NCC at these sites were not significantly affected by CO2.},

The adult shell is globular to conical, transparent, thin, and fragile. Megadenus smithi sp. nov. from Palmyra Atoll, Central Pacific is described based on adult specimens. It differs from its congeneric species in its more robust shell, the pseudopallium does not cover the shell, and its short and contracted proboscis forms a thick disc.

We know surprisingly little about how predator mobility determines important processes of ecosystem connectivity. Here we used a variety of data sources drawn from Palmyra Atoll, a remote tropical marine ecosystem where large predators remain in high abundance, to investigate how these animals foster connectivity. Our results indicate that three of Palmyra's most abundant large predators (e.g., two reef sharks and one snapper) use resources from different habitats creating important linkages across ecosystems. Observations of cross-system foraging such as this have important implications for the understanding of ecosystem functioning, the management of large-predator populations, and the design of conservation measures intended to protect whole ecosystems. In the face of widespread declines of large, mobile predators, it is important that resource managers, policy makers, and ecologists work to understand how these predators create connectivity and to determine the impact that their depletions may be having on the integrity of these linkages.},

Reef shark populations continue to decline even within some of the largest MPAs, fueling unresolved debates over the ability of protected areas to aid mobile species that transit beyond MPA boundaries. We assessed the capacity of a large MPA to conserve grey reef sharks - a Near Threatened species with a widespread distribution and poorly understood offshore movement patterns - using a combination of conventional tags, satellite tags, and an emerging vessel tracking technology. We found that the 54,000km2 U.S. Palmyra Atoll National Wildlife Refuge in the central Pacific Ocean provides substantial protection for grey reef sharks, as two-thirds of satellite-tracked sharks remained within MPA boundaries for the entire study duration. Additionally, our analysis of {\textgreater}0.5 million satellite detections of commercial fishing vessels identified virtually no fishing effort within the refuge and significant effort beyond the MPA perimeter, suggesting that large MPAs can effectively benefit reef sharks and other mobile species if properly enforced. However, our results also highlight limitations of place-based conservation as some of these reef-associated sharks moved surprising distances into pelagic waters (up to 926km from Palmyra Atoll, 810km beyond MPA boundaries). Small-scale fishermen operating beyond MPA boundaries (up to 366km from Palmyra) captured 2\% of sharks that were initially tagged at Palmyra, indicating that large MPAs provide substantial, though incomplete, protection for reef sharks.},

Bait application must be sufficient to be effective, while minimizing environmental hazards by not exceeding designated label rates, prompting our bait density assessments for two aerial drops. With few physical or human resources on this remote, uninhabited atoll, assessments were particularly challenging, requiring observations within 30 min of aerial application to avoid bait loss to rats, crabs, or elements. We estimated bait density using quadrat sampling within 13 terrestrial sampling areas. We also sampled 10 tidal flat areas to assess inadvertent bait scatter into marine aquatic environments. Of particular value for challenging sampling circumstances, our quadrats had to be lightweight and durable, which we addressed by using widely available PVC hoops (“Hula Hoops”), the size of which was ideal for sampling purposes. At 77.5 and 78.7 kg/ha, overall bait densities were very near to the target densities of 80 and 75 kg/ha, respectively. However, considerable variability in bait densities existed among sampled areas, 8.6–178.2 and 31.4–129.5 kg/ha for the respective drops, respectively. Environmental, human, and equipment factors likely accounted for this variability. Tidal flat sampling revealed variable bait scatter into aquatic environments, from 0–46.3 kg/ha across the two drops. No differences were found in average bait densities among 1-, 4-, and 7-m distances from high tide lines. Our methods might broadly assist bait density (and other) surveys under challenging circumstances.},

In total, 115 arthropod taxa were collected, bringing the total number of taxa recorded since 1913 to 162. Few native species were collected; most taxa were accidental introductions also recorded from the Hawaiian Islands, the presumed main source of introductions to Palmyra. The overlap with previous historical surveys in 1913 and 1948 was low ({\textless}40\%), and new species continue to establish, with one species of whitefly reaching pest status between 2003 and 2005. We observed numerous dead or dying large Pisonia grandis, and the green scale Pulvinaria urbicola (Coccidae) was particularly abundant on trees of poor health. Abundant introduced ants, particularly Pheidole megacephala, tended this and other hemipterans feeding on both native and introduced plants. We hypothesize that the Pheidole-Pulvinaria facultative mutualism is causing the decline of Pisonia grandis. Because of the unique properties of Pisonia grandis forest on oceanic atolls, its importance for nesting seabirds, and its alarming global decline, immediate conservation efforts should be directed at controlling introduced Hemiptera and disrupting their mutualisms with nonnative ants on Palmyra Atoll.},

To date, cells identified for shoreline management planning are often extensive, extending for tens to hundreds of km. We suggest that the concept is also applicable to the management of atoll coastlines which, although spatially very small overall, consist of isolated segments with efficient intervening sediment sinks. As an example, Palmyra Atoll, a protected wildlife refuge in the northern Line Islands, is undergoing natural major changes resulting from sediment-related processes. Defining sediment cells as integral parts of management units here will aid decision-making necessary for the protection of specific areas, potentially giving savings in research effort and remedial costs and minimising disruption to other sensitive areas of the reserve. Similar benefits would apply to the management of the coastlines of other atolls.},

Morphological and molecular characters (12S and 16S mitochondrial rRNA and cytochrome b mtDNA sequences) were used to identify the species as Anguilla marmorata Quoy \& Gaimard.

	abstract = {Animals may use a variety of search patterns to locate resources when the exact locations of those resources are unknown. Theoretical and empirical evidence suggests that the optimal type of random walk will vary based on the distribution of resources such as prey. Once resources are located, the animal may utilize a movement strategy that allows it to remain within a small area and maximize resource acquisition (area-restricted searching, ARS). Detecting the location of ARS zones is important, as it identifies profitable habitat to the animal, although such analysis is rarely conducted with fishes. We utilized correlated random walk (CRW), fractal, and first passage time (FPT) analysis to quantify the response of planktivorous manta rays Manta alfredi to spatial scale and identify locations of ARS within lagoons at Palmyra Atoll. Mantas used CRWs at small spatial scales to move between prey patches, but not at larger scales as they performed home-ranging behavior. One domain was located with straighter movements at scales {\textless}330 m, and more tortuous movements at scales {\textgreater}330 m. ARS was located adjacent to ledges with high abundance of plankton, or within channels. Fractal and FPT analyses suggest that mantas used patches that were 5 to 49\% of the scale of their activity space over short time periods (days). Quantitative analytical tools help explain observed patterns of movements and demonstrate the importance of lagoon habitats to these macro-planktivores.},

	abstract = {Use of accelerometers is now widespread within animal biologging as they provide a means of measuring an animal's activity in a meaningful and quantitative way where direct observation is not possible. In sequential acceleration data, there is a natural dependence between observations of behaviour, a fact that has been largely ignored in most analyses. Analyses of acceleration data where serial dependence has been explicitly modelled have largely relied on hidden Markov models (HMMs). Depending on the aim of an analysis, an HMM can be used for state prediction or to make inferences about drivers of behaviour. For state prediction, a supervised learning approach can be applied. That is, an HMM is trained to classify unlabelled acceleration data into a finite set of pre-specified categories. An unsupervised learning approach can be used to infer new aspects of animal behaviour when biologically meaningful response variables are used, with the caveat that the states may not map to specific behaviours. We provide the details necessary to implement and assess an HMM in both the supervised and unsupervised learning context and discuss the data requirements of each case. We outline two applications to marine and aerial systems (shark and eagle) taking the unsupervised learning approach, which is more readily applicable to animal activity measured in the field. HMMs were used to infer the effects of temporal, atmospheric and tidal inputs on animal behaviour. Animal accelerometer data allow ecologists to identify important correlates and drivers of animal activity (and hence behaviour). The HMM framework is well suited to deal with the main features commonly observed in accelerometer data and can easily be extended to suit a wide range of types of animal activity data. The ability to combine direct observations of animal activity with statistical models, which account for the features of accelerometer data, offers a new way to quantify animal behaviour and energetic expenditure and to deepen our insights into individual behaviour as a constituent of populations and ecosystems.},

	abstract = {There is abundant evidence that herbivorous fishes play an important role in mediating the competitive interactions between corals and algae and that with the reduction or absence of these grazers there may be regime shifts from domination by reef-building corals to non-accreting turfs and fleshy algae. This topic is of particular interest because of the perceived, documented, and projected declines in coral abundances across the tropics and because of the myriad of ecosystem services that healthy coral reefs provide to coastal tropical communities. Parrotfishes in particular appear to be important for promoting coral recruitment, because they scrape away bare patches on the substrate creating suitable settlement habitat for coral larvae. Because of this unique function and its potential to influence long-term coral reef resilience, there have been many appeals from the scientific community for the conservation of parrotfishes.
In terrestrial systems the interactions between the spatial patterns of grazing and the spatial patterns of primary producers have been well explored, but we know less about the fine-scale spatial behaviors of individual coral reef herbivores and how these behaviors influence reef benthic dynamics. There is evidence from spatially explicit models of herbivore foraging behavior that the spatial patterns of feeding by individual herbivores may have a significant impact on the long-term outcomes of coral-algal competition. However, there are multiple drivers that have been identified as influential to the spatial behaviors of parrotfishes and there is no current consensus as to what the primary driver is. In the first chapter of this thesis, we explore the relative influences of competition, predation, and resource abundance on the short-term space use patterns and feeding rates of Chlorurus sordidus, an abundant and widespread Pacific parrotfish. We characterized the foraging behaviors of these fish across sites that vary strongly in the presence of piscivorous predators and herbivorous competitors. We found that feeding rates are mainly influenced by direct interference competition and chronic predation risk and that short-term space use is mainly influenced by exploitative competition from the herbivore community. We found little evidence that acute predator presence has any influence on the short-term diurnal foraging behaviors of these fish, even where predators are large, diverse, and abundant. This provides insight into how foraging behaviors may be affected with changing herbivore and piscivore populations, for instance within a Marine Protected Area.
In the second chapter of this thesis we evaluated the movement patterns of Chlorurus microrhinos, a large-bodied Pacific parrotfish, across multiple spatial and temporal scales to determine what biological and environmental driver influence space use patterns at each scale. We found evidence for the influences of reproduction and oceanographic conditions, habitat features, predation, resource abundance and competition, however these drivers operated at varying spatial and temporal scales to influence the movement behaviors of these parrotfish. Large-scale movement was driven by oceanographic conditions that influenced the spatial and temporal patterns of reproductive events, as well as night sheltering behavior that was likely related to habitat selection to mediate predation risk. Fine scale movement patterns appeared to be strongly related to resource abundance and competition. We found that measures of movement and the emergent patterns between movement and these drivers depend heavily on the scale of study.},

Oocyte pigmentation and size comparison with sizes of mature eggs reported in published literature were used to infer intra-and interspecific synchrony and probable spawning phenology in 15 species of Acropora from Palmyra and Kingman atolls in the northern Line Islands. Sampling at both atolls took place in March–April 2002 and 2004. Oocyte sizes were determined from microdissections of fixed, decalcified samples. The majority (91.2\%) of samples (n = 209) were gravid, with high levels of fertility in most (84.3\%) samples. Statistically discrete oocyte size classes could be distinguished in most taxa at each atoll in each year. These discrete oocyte size classes suggest that several episodes of spawning, involving multiple species, take place over 2 or 3 months beginning in early spring. These data, which are the first observations of coral reproductive synchrony in the Line Islands, support the results of other recent studies, suggesting that reproductive synchrony can be a feature of equatorial reef assemblages where the annual ranges of sea-surface temperature and tidal amplitude are small.},

We identified a range of effects that followed from the removal of these large fish. These effects were revealed within weeks of their removal. Removing large fish (1) altered the behavior of prey fish; (2) reduced rates of herbivory on certain species of reef algae; (3) had both direct positive (reduced mortality of coral recruits) and indirect negative (through reduced grazing pressure on competitive algae) impacts on recruiting corals; and (4) tended to decrease abundances of small mobile benthic invertebrates.

	abstract = {Central place foragers (CPF) rest within a central place, and theory predicts that distance of patches from this central place sets the outer limits of the foraging arena. Many marine ectothermic predators behave like CPF animals, but never stop swimming, suggesting that predators will incur ‘travelling’ costs while resting. Currently, it is unknown how these CPF predators behave or how modulation of behavior contributes to daily energy budgets. We combine acoustic telemetry, multi-sensor loggers, and hidden Markov models (HMMs) to generate ‘activity seascapes’, which combine space use with patterns of activity, for reef sharks (blacktip reef and grey reef sharks) at an unfished Pacific atoll. Sharks of both species occupied a central place during the day within deeper, cooler water where they were less active, and became more active over a larger area at night in shallower water. However, video cameras on two grey reef sharks revealed foraging attempts/success occurring throughout the day, and that multiple sharks were refuging in common areas. A simple bioenergetics model for grey reef sharks predicted that diel changes in energy expenditure are primarily driven by changes in swim speed and not body temperature. We provide a new method for simultaneously visualizing diel space use and behavior in marine predators, which does not require the simultaneous measure of both from each animal. We show that blacktip and grey reef sharks behave as CPFs, with diel changes in activity, horizontal and vertical space use. However, aspects of their foraging behavior may differ from other predictions of traditional CPF models. In particular, for species that never stop swimming, patch foraging times may be unrelated to patch travel distance.},

	abstract = {Many terrestrial and marine species have a diel activity pattern, and their acoustic signaling follows their current behavioral state. Whistles and echolocation clicks on long-term recordings produced by melon-headed whales (Peponocephala electra) at Palmyra Atoll indicated that these signals were used selectively during different phases of the day, strengthening the idea of nighttime foraging and daytime resting with afternoon socializing for this species. Spectral features of their echolocation clicks changed from day to night, shifting the median center frequency up. Additionally, click received levels increased with increasing ambient noise during both day and night. Ambient noise over a wide frequency band was on average higher at night. The diel adjustment of click features might be a reaction to acoustic masking caused by these nighttime sounds. Similar adaptations have been documented for numerous taxa in response to noise. Or it could be, unrelated, an increase in biosonar source levels and with it a shift in center frequency to enhance detection distances during foraging at night. Call modifications in intensity, directionality, frequency, and duration according to echolocation task are well established for bats. This finding indicates that melon-headed whales have flexibility in their acoustic behavior, and they collectively and repeatedly adapt their signals from day- to nighttime circumstances.},

	abstract = {Static sensor networks to observe animals are widely used in ecological, management and conservation research, but quantitative methods for designing these networks are underdeveloped. In the context of aquatic systems, we present a method for quasi-optimal network design, which accounts for blocking of detections by obstacles, horizontal and vertical movement behaviour of the target animals, and type of research question (is the network intended for estimation of detailed movement or home range?). Optimal design is defined as the sensor configuration that maximizes the expected number of unique animal detections. As finding the global optimum is generally time consuming, we use a greedy algorithm instead, which places sensors optimally relative to already placed sensors. The design method requires access to topographic data of the study site and knowledge of the sensor detection range. We illustrate the method with real topographic data from a rugose coral reef where network performance is highly influenced by detection shadowing. Network performance is visualized by a coverage map indicating the probability of detection at any location in the study area. The reported unique recovery rate summarizes the expected ability of the network to collect data given the design constraints. Because sensors are placed sequentially, the information gain per sensor can be evaluated and used as a proxy for sensor value. The presented method formalizes important considerations, when designing sensor networks, that were previously often based on heuristics and intuition. The method provides a guide to maximizing the information potential of future monitoring studies as well as a means to improve existing networks. The method is available as an R package and can be tested via an online web tool.},

To address this problem, the authors constructed and compared physically related monthly ENSO indexes. The base index was El Niño index Niño-3.4, the sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly averaged over the equatorial box bounded by 5°N, 5°S, 170°W, and 120°W; the authors also constructed indexes based on the nighttime marine air temperature over the Niño-3.4 region (NMAT3.4) and an equatorial Southern Oscillation index (ESOI). The Niño-3.4 index used the “uninterpolated” sea surface temperature data from the Second Hadley Centre Sea Surface Temperature dataset (HadSST2), a dataset with smaller uncertainty and better geographical coverage than others. In constructing the index, data at each point for a given month were weighted to take into account the typical considerable spatial variation of the SST anomaly over the Niño-3.4 box as well as the number of observations at that point for that month. Missing monthly data were interpolated and “noise” was reduced by using the result that Niño-3.4 has essentially the same calendar month amplitude structure every year. This 12-point calendar month structure from April to March was obtained by an EOF analysis over the last 58 yr and then was fitted to the entire monthly time series using a least squares approach. Equivalent procedures were followed for NMAT3.4 and ESOI. The new ESOI uses Darwin atmospheric pressure in the west and is based on theory that allows for variations of the atmospheric boundary layer depth across the Pacific. The new Niño-3.4 index was compared with NMAT3.4, the new ESOI, and with a record of δ18O from a coral at Palmyra, an atoll inside the region Niño-3.4 (Cobb et al.). Correlation coefficients between Niño-3.4 and the three monthly indexes mentioned above before 1950 are 0.84, 0.87, 0.73 and 0.93, 0.86, 0.73 for decadal time scales. These relatively high correlation coefficients between physically related but independent monthly time series suggest that this study has improved knowledge of low-frequency variability. All four indexes are consistent with a rise in Niño-3.4 SST and the weakening of the equatorial Pacific winds since about 1970.},

	abstract = {We present a hydrodynamic analysis of an atoll system from modeling simulations using a coupled wave and three-dimensional hydrodynamic model (COAWST) applied to Palmyra Atoll in the Central Pacific. This is the first time the vortex force formalism has been applied in a highly frictional reef environment. The model results agree well with field observations considering the model complexity in terms of bathymetry, bottom roughness, and forcing (waves, wind, metrological, tides, regional boundary conditions), and open boundary conditions. At the atoll scale, strong regional flows create flow separation and a well-defined wake, similar to 2D flow past a cylinder. Circulation within the atoll is typically forced by waves and tides, with strong waves from the north driving flow from north to south across the atoll, and from east to west through the lagoon system. Bottom stress is significant for depths less than about 60m, and in addition to the model bathymetry, is important for correct representation of flow in the model. Connectivity within the atoll system shows that the general trends follow the mean flow paths. However, some connectivity exists between all regions of the atoll system due to nonlinear processes such as eddies and tidal phasing. Moderate wave stress, short travel time (days since entering the reef system), and low temperature appear to be the most ideal conditions for high coral cover at this site.},

	abstract = {The reefs at Palmyra Atoll, a small outlying atoll in the equatorial Pacific, have been undergoing a phase shift from scleractinian corals to a corallimorph-dominated benthos. It has been unclear whether there has been cryptic speciation or morphological plasticity leading to different ecotypes of Rhodactis howesii. Here, we use mitochondrial genomic analysis to assess species validation and underlying cause of morphological variation across the atoll. We mapped sequenced reads to Rhodactis indosinensis, R. howesii’s closest recorded genomic taxon. In addition to one individual from American Sāmoa, we assessed phylogenetic relationships of published corallimorph genomes with those from Palmyra. There was no identifiable population structure within Palmyra, and available dinoflagellate symbiont communities were consistent among the sequenced individuals. There were noticeable differences in symbiont communities between Palmyra and American Sāmoa individuals, as well as six fixed nucleotide differences. We conclude that the lack of taxonomically validated genetic reference material together with vague species descriptions, morphological plasticity and overlap among morphological characters, combine to raise doubts about the validity of the currently accepted species name, R. howesii. Comparison of our results to all currently available genetic data for corallimorpharians suggests that the species at Palmyra is most closely related to an unidentified species of Rhodactis from Okinawa. However, taxonomically confirmed R. howesii is absent from genetic databases, so no firm conclusions about species identification can yet be drawn. It seems clear that this group is in need of additional taxonomic work and a broad phylogenetic survey of taxa with geographic distribution would further our understanding of marine biodiversity, conservation, and invasion dynamics of this understudied group.},

The pathogenic bacterium, referred toas Vibrio coralyticus YB, wasclassified as a member of the genus Vibrio. Based on its16S rDNA sequence, V. coralyticus is probably a new species. In controlled aquariaexperiments at 26–29°C, inoculation of pure cultures ofV. coralyticus YB either into theseawater or by direct contact onto the coral caused tissue lysis ofP. damicornis fragments. At29°C, lysis began as small white spots after 3–5 days, rapidlyspreading so that by 2 weeks the entire tissue was destroyed, leaving onlythe intact bare skeleton. When an infected diseased coral was placed in directcontact with a healthy one, the healthy coral lysed in 2–4 days,further indicating that the disease was contagious. Inoculation with as few as30 bacteria ml–1 was sufficient to infect and lysecorals. Seawater temperature was a critical variable for the infectiousprocess: infection and lysis occurred rapidly at 27–29°C, slowly at26°C and was not observed at 25°C. The data suggest that the presenceof V. coralyticus YB, even in lownumbers, in seawater surrounding a coral reef will lead to tissue destructionof P. damicornis, when seawatertemperatures rise.},

	abstract = {Passive acoustic monitoring is a well-established tool for researching the occurrence, movements, and ecology of a wide variety of marine mammal species. Advances in hardware and data collection have exponentially increased the volumes of passive acoustic data collected, such that discoveries are now limited by the time required to analyze rather than collect the data. In order to address this limitation, we trained a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to identify humpback whale song in over 187,000 h of acoustic data collected at 13 different monitoring sites in the North Pacific over a 14-year period. The model successfully detected 75 s audio segments containing humpback song with an average precision of 0.97 and average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) of 0.992. The model output was used to analyze spatial and temporal patterns of humpback song, corroborating known seasonal patterns in the Hawaiian and Mariana Islands, including occurrence at remote monitoring sites beyond well-studied aggregations, as well as novel discovery of humpback whale song at Kingman Reef, at 5∘ North latitude. This study demonstrates the ability of a CNN trained on a small dataset to generalize well to a highly variable signal type across a diverse range of recording and noise conditions. We demonstrate the utility of active learning approaches for creating high-quality models in specialized domains where annotations are rare. These results validate the feasibility of applying deep learning models to identify highly variable signals across broad spatial and temporal scales, enabling new discoveries through combining large datasets with cutting edge tools.},

	abstract = {Accurate estimation of central tropical Pacific (CTP) climate variability on interannual to centennial time scales is required for robust projections of future global climate trends. Here we outline an approach that blends instrumental and coral proxy observations to yield a continuous, monthly resolved record of climate evolution in the CTP spanning the past 160 years. We concatenate coral oxygen isotope (δ18O) records from multiple living and fossil corals collected from Fanning Island (4°N, 160°W) and Palmyra Island (5°N; 162°W) located in the heart of the El Niño–Southern Oscillation. We use the regularized expectation maximization (RegEM) method to impute missing data across short gaps of 5 to 23 years within and beyond individual coral records. The resulting monthly resolved Fanning/Palmyra Island climate record spans continuously from 1863 to 2016 and provides an example of how extended time series can be built from shorter coral segments. The extended record highlights the strong trend toward warmer and wetter mean conditions in late twentieth century, in agreement with the majority of climate model hindcast simulations. The continuous reconstruction also enables a direct comparison of four exceptionally strong El Niño events (1877–1878, 1940–1941, 1997–1998, and 2015–2016). Three of these very strong El Niño events in the CTP featured a precursor warm event in the prior year and that may have favored the development of a strong El Niño event.},
