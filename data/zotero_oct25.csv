Our characterization spans several coincident gradients (in human habitation and exploitation, latitude, and nutrient upwelling) from uninhabited, presently unfished, and oligotrophic Kingman to relatively densely populated, fished, and equatorially upwelled Kiritimati. Major findings are most consistent with direct effects of extraction on large-bodied predators and indirect effects on lower-level assemblage structure. Fish assemblages at Palmyra and especially Kingman atolls were characterized by high total standing biomass, large average body sizes, a preponderance of apex predators and other piscivorous fishes in an inverted biomass pyramid, few and small planktivorous fishes, and herbivores dominated by non-territorial species. Median body sizes at color change from initial to terminal phase (an index of sex change in parrotfishes) were also small for 4 species of parrotfish at Kingman and Palmyra. Fish assemblages at Tabuaeran and especially Kiritimati atolls had starkly contrasting characteristics: piscivorous and other fisheries-targeted fishes were depauperate, lower-trophic levels dominated fish biomass, planktivorous fishes were targer-bodied and more numerous, territorial herbivores were better represented, and size at maturation in parrotfishes was proportionately larger. Our results show the effects that even modest fishing effort can have on assemblage structure and indicate the importance of reefs like Kingman as increasingly rare relicts of natural coral reefs, providing insights into the natural structure and function of these ecosystems.","2008","2021-09-23 22:35:32","2021-09-23 22:35:32","","199-215","","","365","","Mar Ecol Prog Ser","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000259379600018","","","","","","","apex predation,; biomass,; body size at sex change,; body-size,; communities,; competition; coral-reef-fish,; density,; fisheries extraction,; great-barrier-reef,; growth,; inverted biomass pyramid,; latitudinal gradient,; mortality,; parrotfishes,; predator,; prey body size distribution,; upwelling,","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Palmyra Atoll is relatively pristine while Kiritimati Island is heavily fished.

The surveys found monogeneans, digeneans, cestodes, nematodes, acanthocephalans, and copepods. Parasite richness was higher at Palmyra compared to Kiritimati for all five fish species. Fishes from Palmyra also tended to have more parasites species per host, higher parasite prevalence, and higher parasite abundance than did fishes from Kiritimati. The lower parasitism at Kiritimati may result from a simplified food web due to over fishing. Low biodiversity could impair parasite transmission by reducing the availability of hosts required by parasites with complex life cycles. Most notably, the lower abundances of larval shark tapeworms at Kiritimati presumably reflect the fact that fishing has greatly depleted sharks there in comparison to Palmyra.","2008-09","2021-09-23 22:35:32","2021-09-23 22:35:32","","338-345","","3","5","","","","","","","","","","","","","","18846315","","","Number: 3","","","","Animals,; Arthropods,; Ecosystem,; Fish Diseases/epidemiology/parasitology,; Fishes/parasitology,; Helminths/isolation & purification,; Pacific Islands,; Parasitic Diseases, Animal/epidemiology/parasitology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To date, cells identified for shoreline management planning are often extensive, extending for tens to hundreds of km. We suggest that the concept is also applicable to the management of atoll coastlines which, although spatially very small overall, consist of isolated segments with efficient intervening sediment sinks. As an example, Palmyra Atoll, a protected wildlife refuge in the northern Line Islands, is undergoing natural major changes resulting from sediment-related processes. Defining sediment cells as integral parts of management units here will aid decision-making necessary for the protection of specific areas, potentially giving savings in research effort and remedial costs and minimising disruption to other sensitive areas of the reserve. Similar benefits would apply to the management of the coastlines of other atolls. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

We used acoustic telemetry to quantify the movement patterns of blacktip reef sharks (Carcharhinus melanopterus) at Palmyra Atoll National Wildlife Refuge, in the Pacific Ocean. Sharks had relatively small home ranges over a timescale of days to weeks (0.55 +/- 0.24 km2) and showed strong site fidelity to sand-flat ledges within the west lagoon over a three-year period. Sharks showed evidence of diel and tidal movements, and they utilized certain regions of the west lagoon disproportionately. There were ontogenetic shifts in habitat selection, with smaller sharks showing greater selection for sand-flat habitats, and pups (total length 35-61 cm) utilizing very shallow waters on sand-flats, potentially as nursery areas. Adult sharks selected ledge habitats and had lower rates of movement when over sand-flats and ledges than they did over lagoon waters. Fractal analysis of movements showed that over periods of days, sharks used patches that were 3-17% of the scale of their home range. Repeat horizontal movements along ledge habitats consisted of relatively straight movements, which theoretical models consider the most efficient search strategy when forage patches may be spatially and temporally unpredictable. Although sharks moved using a direct walk while in patches, they appeared to move randomly between patches. Microhabitat quantity and quality had large effects on blacktip reef shark movements, which have consequences for the life-history characteristics of the species and potentially the spatial distribution of behaviorally mediated effects on lower trophic levels throughout the Palmyra ecosystem.","2009-04","2021-09-23 22:35:32","2021-09-23 22:35:32","","996-1008","","4","90","","","","","","","","","","","","","","19449694","","","Number: 4","","","","Animals,; Ecosystem,; Behavior,; Motor Activity,; Sharks/physiology,; Time Factors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Most studies focus on density-mediated trophic cascades, where removal of predators alternately causes increases and decreases in abundances of lower trophic levels. However, cascades could also be driven by where and when prey forage rather than solely by prey abundance. Over a large gradient of fishing intensity in the central Pacific's remote northern Line Islands, including a nearly pristine, baseline coral reef system, we found that changes in predation risk elicit strong behavioral responses in foraging patterns across multiple prey fish species. These responses were observed as a function of both short-term (""acute"") risk and longer-term (""chronic"") risk, as well as when prey were exposed to model predators to isolate the effect of perceived predation risk from other potentially confounding factors. Compared to numerical prey responses, antipredator behavioral responses such as these can potentially have far greater net impacts (by occurring over entire assemblages) and operate over shorter temporal scales (with potentially instantaneous response times) in transmitting top-down effects. A rich body of literature exists on both the direct effects of human removal of predators from ecosystems and predators' effects on prey behavior. Our results draw together these lines of research and provide the first empirical evidence that large-scale human removal of predators from a natural ecosystem indirectly alters prey behavior. These behavioral changes may, in turn, drive previously unsuspected alterations in reef food webs.","2010-12","2021-09-23 22:35:32","2021-09-23 22:35:32","","3563-3571","","12","91","","","","","","","","","","","","","","21302828","","","Number: 12","","","","Animals,; Ecosystem,; Feeding Behavior/physiology,; Fisheries,; Fishes/physiology,; Oceans and Seas,; Population Density","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Statistical modeling has been underutilized in coral disease research to explore the spatial patterns that result from this triad of interactions. We tested the hypotheses that: 1) coral diseases show distinct associations with multiple environmental factors, 2) incorporating interactions (synergistic collinearities) among environmental variables is important when predicting coral disease spatial patterns, and 3) modeling overall coral disease prevalence (the prevalence of multiple diseases as a single proportion value) will increase predictive error relative to modeling the same diseases independently. Four coral diseases: Porites growth anomalies (PorGA), Porites tissue loss (PorTL), Porites trematodiasis (PorTrem), and Montipora white syndrome (MWS), and their interactions with 17 predictor variables were modeled using boosted regression trees (BRT) within a reef system in Hawaii. Each disease showed distinct associations with the predictors. Environmental predictors showing the strongest overall associations with the coral diseases were both biotic and abiotic. PorGA was optimally predicted by a negative association with turbidity, PorTL and MWS by declines in butterflyfish and juvenile parrotfish abundance respectively, and PorTrem by a modal relationship with Porites host cover. Incorporating interactions among predictor variables contributed to the predictive power of our models, particularly for PorTrem. Combining diseases (using overall disease prevalence as the model response), led to an average six-fold increase in cross-validation predictive deviance over modeling the diseases individually. We therefore recommend coral diseases to be modeled separately, unless known to have etiologies that respond in a similar manner to particular environmental conditions. Predictive statistical modeling can help to increase our understanding of coral disease ecology worldwide.","2010-02-17","2021-09-23 22:35:32","2021-09-23 22:35:32","","e9264","","2","5","","","","","","","","","","","","","","20174663","","","Number: 2","","","","Animals,; Ecosystem,; Anthozoa/growth & development/parasitology,; Ecology/statistics & numerical data,; Geologic Sediments/chemistry,; Hawaii,; Host-Parasite Interactions,; Models, Biological,; physiology,; Regression Analysis,; Salinity,; Trematoda/physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Palmyra Atoll allows us to study disease dynamics under near-pristine, functionally intact conditions. We examined disease prevalence among all known species of scleractinian coral, soft coral and zoanthid (Palythoa) at a variety of coral reef habitats at Palmyra over a 2 yr period. In 2008, overall disease prevalence across the atoll was low (0.33%), but higher on the shallower backreef (0.88%) and reef terrace (0.80%) than on the deeper forereef (0.09%). Scleractinian coral disease prevalence was higher (0.30%) than were soft coral and zoanthid disease (0.03% combined). Growth anomalies (GAs) were the most commonly encountered lesions, with scleractinian species in the genera Astreopora (2.12%), Acropora (1.30%), and Montipora (0.98%) showing the highest prevalence atoll-wide. Discoloration necrosis (DN) was most prevalent in the zoanthid Palythoa tuberculosa (1.18%), although the soft coral Sinulana and Montipora also had a prevalence of 0.44 and 0.01%, respectively. Overall disease prevalence within permanently marked transects increased from 0.65% in 2008 to 0.79% in 2009. Palythoa DN contributed most to this increased prevalence, which coincided with rising temperatures during the 2009 El Nino. GAs on the majority of susceptible genera at Palmyra increased in number over time, and led to tissue death. Host distribution and environmental factors (e.g., temperature) appear to be important for determining spatiotemporal patterns of disease at Palmyra. More sophisticated analyses are required to tease apart the likely inter-correlated proximate drivers of disease occurrence on remote, near-pristine reefs.","2011-04-06","2021-09-23 22:35:32","2021-09-23 22:35:32","","89-100","","2","94","","","","","","","","","","","","","","21648237","","","Number: 2","","","","Pacific Islands,; Time Factors; Animals; Anthozoa/microbiology,; Coral Reefs,; Hot Temperature,; Pacific Ocean,","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study experimentally (1) examined species-specific responses to seabird guano gradients, (2) considered the role that differential functional traits among species play in altering plant response to guano, and (3) investigated the implications of seabird guano on range-expanding species. METHODS: Using a greenhouse fertilization experiment, we examined how guano fertilization affects the growth and functional traits of four tree species dominant in the Pacific Islands: Cocos nucifera, Pisonia grandis, Scaevola sericea, and Tournefortia argentea. In these systems, seabirds are frequently found in association with three of these four species; the remaining species, C. nucifera, is a recently proliferating species commonly found in the region but rarely associated with seabirds. KEY RESULTS: We determined that responses to guano addition differed significantly between species in ways that were consistent with predictions based on differing functional traits among species. Notably, we demonstrated that C. nucifera showed no growth responses to guano additions, whereas all seabird-associated plants showed strong responses. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide experimental evidence of differential species response to guano additions, suggesting that differences in species functional traits may contribute to changes in plant communities in seabird-dominated areas, with seabird-associated species garnering performance advantages in these high-nutrient environments. Among these species, results also suggest that C. nucifera may have a competitive advantage in low-nutrient environments, providing an unusual example of how a range-expanding plant species can profit from low-nutrient environments.","2011-02","2021-09-23 22:35:32","2021-09-23 22:35:32","","207-214","","2","98","","","","","","","","","","","","","","21613110","","","Number: 2","","","","Animals,; Birds; Boraginaceae/growth & development,; Cocos/growth & development,; Fertilizers,; Geography,; Magnoliopsida/classification/growth & development,; Manure,; Nyctaginaceae/growth & development,; Species Specificity,; Trees/classification/growth & development,; Tropical Climate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We quantified standing stock and input rates to the detrital resource pool in exposed forereef and protected backreef habitats of Palmyra Atoll National Wildlife Refuge and measured the trophic structure of the overlying fish assemblage. While detrital standing stock was 1.6 times higher on the backreef than on the forereef, detrital input rates were 1.7 to 2.9 times higher on the forereef. Planktivores were the most abundant guild in the fore reef habitat, and stable isotope signatures of detritus reflected a greater input from pelagic sources (i.e. depleted in (13C)). In contrast, herbivores and detritivores numerically dominated the backreef habitat and detrital stable isotope signatures appeared to be predominately of benthic origin (i.e. enriched in C-13). Through total organic carbon (TOC) and nitrogen analyses we found that benthic detritus may represent a significant nutritional source. Converting total nitrogen into maximum protein estimates, we found high benthic deposition of protein (104 to 124 mg m(-2) d(-1)) and organic carbon (184 to 190 mg m(-2) d(-1)), but very low standing stocks of these materials (protein: 5 to 6 mg m(-2), organic carbon: 46 to 63 mg m(-2)). While high water flow rates may explain low standing stocks of detritus in forereef habitats, the lower flow rates in backreef habitats suggest that removal of this material is via consumption by abundant roving detritivorous fishes. Our results provide support for the hypothesis that reef fish detritivory represents a significant consumer-mediated energy pathway, promoting nutrient recycling by linking many elements of a complex food web.","2013","2021-09-23 22:35:33","2021-09-23 22:35:33","","181-195","","","482","","Mar Ecol Prog Ser","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000319337100015","","","","","","","acanthurus-nigrofuscus; carbon; coral reef; damselfishes pomacentridae; detritivore; detritus; epilithic algal; fish; food web; functional-analysis; herbivorous fishes; nitrogen; organic-matter; parrotfishes family scaridae; spatial-patterns; stable isotopes; stable-isotopes; trophic status","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There was no clear evidence that injuries sustained during GA removal increased susceptibility to GA development in either coral species. Based on these results, I hypothesize that the factors inducing GAs in Acropora acuminata are localized, whereas those in Montipora efflorescens appear more systemic throughout the colony-perhaps the result of a genetically-based factor, or a persistent causative agent such as a virus. GA removal may therefore be effective for targeted rescues of particular coral species and morphologies in reef systems with low overall disease prevalence and is likely to be most effective for scleractinian corals if complimented by management actions that address the ultimate drivers of GAs on coral reefs.","2013-10-11","2021-09-23 22:35:33","2021-09-23 22:35:33","","181-185","","2","106","","","","","","","","","","","","","","24113251","","","Number: 2","","","","Clonal regrowth,; Coral disease management; Growth anomaly,; Injury,; Morphology,; Recovery,","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we describe spatial patterns in their benthic communities across reef habitats and depths, and consider these in the context of oceanographic gradients. Benthic communities at both locations were dominated by calcifying organisms (54-86% cover), namely hard corals (20-74%) and crustose coralline algae (CCA) (10-36%). While turf algae were relatively common at both locations (8-22%), larger fleshy macroalgae were virtually absent at Kingman (<1%) and rare at Palmyra (0.7-9.3%). Hard coral cover was higher, but with low diversity, in more sheltered habitats such as Palmyra's backreef and Kingman's patch reefs. Almost exclusive dominance by slow-growing Porites on Kingman's patch reefs provides indirect evidence of competitive exclusion, probably late in a successional sequence. In contrast, the more exposed forereef habitats at both Kingman and Palmyra had higher coral diversity and were characterized by fast-growing corals (e.g., Acropora and Pocillopora), indicative of more dynamic environments. In general at both locations, soft coral cover increased with depth, likely reflecting increasingly efficient heterotrophic abilities. CCA and fleshy macroalgae cover decreased with depth, likely due to reduced light. Cover of other calcified macroalgae, predominantly Halimeda, increased with depth. This likely reflects the ability of many calcifying macroalgae to efficiently harvest light at deeper depths, in combination with an increased nutrient supply from upwelling promoting growth. At Palmyra, patterns of hard coral cover with depth were inconsistent, but cover peaked at mid-depths at Kingman. On Kingman's forereef, benthic community composition was strongly related to wave energy, with hard coral cover decreasing and becoming more spatially clustered with increased wave energy, likely as a result of physical damage leading to patches of coral in localized shelter. In contrast, the cover of turf algae at Kingman was positively related to wave energy, reflecting their ability to rapidly colonize newly available space. No significant patterns with wave energy were observed on Palmyra's forereef, suggesting that a more detailed model is required to study biophysical coupling there. Kingman, Palmyra, and other remote oceanic reefs provide interesting case studies to explore biophysical influences on benthic ecology and dynamics.","2013","2021-09-23 22:35:33","2021-09-23 22:35:33","","e81","","","1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","23734341","","","","","","","Benthic competition,; Coral,; Kingman Reef,; Macroalgae,; Palmyra Atoll,; Spatial clustering,; Wave exposure,; Wave impacts,; Zonation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We determined that (1) there is no effect of ecosystem size or productive space on food chain length; (2) rather, food chain length increases strongly and linearly with productivity; and (3) the observed changes in food chain length are likely achieved through a combination of changes in predator size, predator behavior, and consumer diversity along gradients in productivity.

High-resolution bathymetric data combined with in situ oceanographic measurements and a nearshore hydrodynamic model revealed complex intra-atoll gradients in geomorphic complexity, wave forcing, currents, and temperature. For example, maximum wave-driven bed shear stress spatially varied on the forereef (15-20 m depth) by over 2 orders of magnitude, peaking in areas exposed to multiple wave regimes. Benthic community composition, quantified via towed-diver imagery collected in a complete circumnavigation of the atoll (similar to 40 km), also exhibited considerable spatial heterogeneity. Benthic competitors showed distinct, non-linear threshold-type responses to variations in physical drivers. For example, at a wave-driven bed shear stress threshold of 18 N m(-2), calcifying crustose coralline algae lost relative dominance and were replaced by non-calcifying fleshy turf algae. Hard coral communities also demonstrated considerable flexibility in response to physical drivers, with distinct shifts in the relative dominance of different growth morphologies along gradients of wave forcing, presumably as a means of local adaptation. Our results highlight (1) the importance of natural gradients in physical drivers in determining dominant benthic regimes on coral reefs (e.g. calcifying vs. fleshy), (2) that non-linear thresholds (or tipping points) exist between key benthic competitors in response to key physical drivers, and (3) that coral assemblages show inherent flexibility and can reorganize in response to physical drivers rather than exhibit wholesale changes in overall cover.","2015-03-02","2021-09-23 22:35:33","2021-09-23 22:35:33","","33-48","","","522","","Mar Ecol Prog Ser","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000350667800003","","","","","","","great-barrier-reef,; base-lines,; bed shear stress,; biophysical coupling,; central pacific,; community structure,; competition,; coral morphology,; habitat complexity,; hawaiian-islands,; hydrodynamic disturbances,; internal waves,; northern line islands,; reef-building organisms,; regime shift,; regression trees,; tipping points,; water velocity; waves,","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we study the reported introduction of Haliclona (Soestella) caerulea from the Caribbean to Palmyra Atoll via Hawai'i using morphological characteristics and genetic analyses based on one nuclear (18s rDNA) and three mitochondrial (COI, the barcoding COI extension (COI ext.) and rnl rDNA) markers. Despite no clear division in lengths of the oxea spicules between the samples, both mtDNA and nDNA phylogenetic trees supported similar topologies resolving two distinct clades. Across the two clades, the concatenated mtDNA tree resolved twelve subclades, with the COI ext. yielding most of the variability between the samples. Low sequence divergence values (0.68%) between two of the subclades indicate that the same species is likely to occur at Palmyra, Hawai'i and the Caribbean, supporting the hypothesis that H. caerulea was introduced to Palmyra from the Caribbean, although whether species came directly from the Caribbean to Palmyra or from Hawai'i remains unresolved. Conversely, the pattern of highly divergent cryptic species supports the notion that traditionally used spicule measurements are taxonomically unreliable in this group. This study illustrates how understanding the scale of within- as opposed to between-species level genetic variation is critical for interpreting biogeographic patterns and inferring the origins of introduced organisms.","2015","2021-09-23 22:35:33","2021-09-23 22:35:33","","e1170","","","3","","","","","","","","","","","","","","26339548","","","","","","","Atoll lagoon,; Caribbean,; mDNA,; Micromorphology,; nDNA; Non-indigenous species,; Phylogeography,; Porifera,; Spicules,","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Refraction of waves along the reef terraces due to variations in bathymetry leads to focusing of waves in specific locations. Bottom friction, modeled with a modified bottom roughness formulation, is the significant source of wave energy dissipation on the atoll, a result that is consistent with available observations of wave damping on Palmyra. Indeed modeled wave dissipation rates from bottom friction are on average larger than dissipation rates due to breaking and are an order of magnitude larger than what has been observed on other, less geometrically complex reefs, a result which should be corroborated with future in situ measurements. The SWAN wave model with a modified bottom friction formulation better predicts bulk wave energy properties than the existing formulation at our measurement stations.

We use data from an eight-year tag-recapture program with spatially explicit, capture-recapture models to re-examine the population size and density of a key top predator at Palmyra atoll, the same location that inspired the idea of inverted trophic biomass pyramids in coral reef ecosystems. Given that animal movement is suspected to have significantly biased early biomass estimates of highly mobile top predators, we focused our reassessment on the most mobile and most abundant predator at Palmyra, the grey reef shark (Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos). We estimated a density of 21.3 (95% CI 17.8, 24.7) grey reef sharks/km(2), which is an order of magnitude lower than the estimates that suggested an inverted trophic pyramid.

Most existing studies of marine recreation ecology have focused on behavioural changes resulting from direct interactions between humans and wildlife including provisioning. However, non-consumptive, non-provisioning human impacts may also result in persistent behavioural impacts to shark populations. In this study, we examined differences in residency, abundance, and behaviour of reef sharks at Palmyra Atoll in response to long-term SCUBA diving activity, using a combination of survey techniques including baited remote underwater video systems and multi-year passive acoustic monitoring. In most locations with recreational diving operations, some level of human impact is pervasive, but on Palmyra, extractive fishing is prohibited, and scientific diving activities are concentrated on just a few sites that house long-term monitoring projects. These sites experience relatively intensive diving, while the majority of the island is entirely undived. Evidence from elsewhere has shown that sharks behaviourally respond to people in the water over short time scales, but our results indicate that this response may not persist. We did not detect differences in reef shark abundance or behaviour between heavily dived and undived locations, nor were there differences in shark residency patterns at dived and undived sites in a year with substantial diving activity and a year without any diving.

In the current study we quantified space use and feeding rates of the parrotfish, Chlorurus spilurus, across a strong gradient of food resources and predator and competitor abundance across two islands with drastically different fisheries management schemes. We found evidence that while feeding rates of this species are affected by direct interference competition and chronic predation risk, space use appears to be primarily related to exploitative competition with the surrounding herbivore community. We found no evidence that predation risk influences diurnal foraging space use in this small bodied parrotfish species. Additionally, we found the influence of chronic predation risk on feeding rates of this species to be less dramatic than the results of recent studies that used model predators to measure acute behavioral responses of other species of herbivorous fishes.

Here, we used an in situ imaging technique to create large-area photomosaics of 16 plots at Palmyra Atoll, central Pacific, each covering 100 m(2) of benthic habitat. We mapped the location of 44,008 coral colonies and identified each to the lowest taxonomic level possible. Using metrics of spatial dispersion, we tested for departures from spatial randomness. We also used targeted model fitting to explore candidate processes leading to differences in spatial patterns among taxa. Most taxa were clustered and the degree of clustering varied by taxon. A small number of taxa did not significantly depart from randomness and none revealed evidence of spatial uniformity. Importantly, taxa that readily fragment or tolerate stress through partial mortality were more clustered. With little exception, clustering patterns were consistent with models of fragmentation and dispersal limitation. In some taxa, dispersion was linearly related to abundance, suggesting density dependence of spatial patterning. The spatial patterns of stony corals are non-random and reflect fundamental life-history characteristics of the taxa, suggesting that the reef landscape may, in many cases, have important elements of spatial predictability.","2017-12","2021-09-23 22:35:33","2021-09-23 22:35:33","","1291-1305","","4","36","","Coral Reefs","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000415691300030","","","Number: 4","","","","communities,; community structure,; caribbean coral,; coral reefs,; dynamics,; ecology,; hermatypic corals,; landscape ecology,; palmyra atoll,; photomosaics,; recruitment; reproduction,; spatial dispersion,; survival,; tropical forest,; wave energy,","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Through a suite of pathways, we find this palm drives near-complete ecosystem state change when it becomes dominant. Abiotic conditions are transformed, with major soil nutrients 2.7-11.5 times lower and water stress 15% elevated in palm- dominated forests compared with native forest. Faunal communities are likewise dramatically altered, not only in composition but also in behavior, body size, and body condition. Biotic interactions, including herbivory rates, palatability, and seed predation, are likewise changed. Cumulatively, these changes transform food webs, leading to dramatically shortened and simplified food chains in invaded ecosystems. Many of these changes appear to create slow- acting feedback loops that favor the palm at the expense of native species.

Despite the ecological significance and geographic range of Cocos expansion, large-scale assessments of coconut proliferation are still lacking due to the isolated nature of many islands where Cocos is found. Remote sensing approaches are often used to monitor forest composition at broad scales, but the small physical size of most islands limits the use of many popular satellite sensors with 15-30 m resolution. The recent availability of very high resolution (<5 m) satellite imagery facilitates novel assessment of this major ecological pattern, but the increased resolution introduces problematic 'salt-and-pepper' effects due to the heterogeneous nature of palm frond canopies. This case study evaluates the effectiveness of applying grey-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) textural features to very high resolution (0.5-2 m) WorldView-2 imagery to resolve the canopy heterogeneity problem and map the extent of Cocos spread on 21 islets of Palmyra Atoll, a protected United States National Wildlife Refuge in the Northern Line Islands. A random forest (RF)-driven classification scheme differentiating between coconut palms, native trees including Pisonia grandis, and endemic Scaevola sericea shrubs achieved 97.0% overall accuracy and 98.4% producer's and user's accuracies for the coconut palm class when trained on a combined spectral and GLCM textural feature set. Classifications restricted to the eight spectral bands of WorldView-2 are not only less accurate (89.4% overall accuracy), but also significantly worse at identifying Cocos canopies (79.0% versus 98.0% accuracy when GLCM textures are included). However, paring down the full set of sixteen spectral and textural features to the three most important of each type did not result in significant changes in accuracy. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of a joint high-resolution textural and spectral approach for remotely quantifying the spread of Cocos and its impacts on native tree communities throughout the tropics, including remote island locations.","2019-10-02","2021-09-23 22:35:33","2021-09-23 22:35:33","","1-27","","19","40","","Int J Remote Sens","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000465762800001","","","Number: 19","","","","atoll,; accuracy; land-cover classification,; level cooccurrence matrix,; nucifera,; random forest classifier,","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet, stable isotope data from the present study suggest that substantial resource partitioning occurs among tropical seabird communities, both between and within species. In the present study, we compared δ13C and δ15N levels among 8 sympatric tropical seabird species. For a subset of these species, we also examined isotopic levels across years, breeding periods, and sexes. When breeding and non-breeding periods were both considered, we found that all species occupied distinct isotopic niches across at least one time period. Resource partitioning by age (within the same year) and year studied (for birds of the same age), within species was observed in all the species we examined. However, niche separation by sex appeared to be relatively uncommon even in sexually dimorphic species. As a group, seabirds were isotopically distinct from other marine predators. There was a strong correlation between both body mass and wing loading ratios and foraging area, as evaluated using δ13C levels. Cumulatively, the isotopic patterns observed are consistent with diet-based surveys of resource partitioning during the breeding period. Importantly, these data provide additional evidence to suggest that substantial niche partitioning among tropical seabird species persists even during non-breeding periods in open ocean environments, when direct diet-based surveys are difficult to conduct.","2010-10-14","2021-09-23 22:35:33","2021-09-23 22:35:33","2021-06-28 14:27:44","285-294","","","416","","Mar.

The nature of plant-driven nutrient depletions and the mechanisms by which these might occur are relatively poorly understood. In this study we demonstrate that the proliferation of the commonly introduced coconut palm,               Cocos nucifera               , interrupts the flow of allochthonous marine subsidies to terrestrial ecosystems via an indirect effect: impact on birds. Birds avoid nesting or roosting in               C. nucifera               , thus reducing the critical nutrient inputs they bring from the marine environment. These decreases in marine subsidies then lead to reductions in available soil nutrients, decreases in leaf nutrient quality, diminished leaf palatability, and reduced herbivory.  This nutrient depletion pathway contrasts the more typical patterns of nutrient enrichment that follow plant species introductions. Research on the effects of spatial subsidy disruptions on ecosystems has not yet examined interruptions driven by changes within the recipient community, such as plant community shifts. The ubiquity of coconut palm introductions across the tropics and subtropics makes these observations particularly noteworthy. Equally important, the case of               C. nucifera               provides a strong demonstration of how plant community changes can dramatically impact the supply of allochthonous nutrients and thereby reshape energy flow in ecosystems.","2010-02-02","2021-09-23 22:35:33","2021-09-23 22:35:33","2021-06-28 14:28:11","2072-2077","","5","107","","Proc Natl Acad Sci USA","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","Number: 5","","","","Animals,; Ecosystem,; Pacific Islands,; Tropical Climate; Diet,; Food Chain,; Biomass,; Birds/physiology,; Cocos/metabolism,; Marine Biology; Plants/metabolism,; Soil/analysis,; Trees/metabolism,","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In some cases, the dominance of palms has been associated with a depauperate understorey and high rates of native seedling mortality. A variety of different potential mechanisms has been suggested to explain the sustained palm dominance in the understorey and canopy of these forests. Working in a Cocos nucifera-dominated wet tropical forest at Palmyra Atoll in the central Paciﬁc, we examine how litterfall from this pantropical, and economically important palm, impacts seedling survival. We compare rates of litterfall, and rates of litterfall-associated damage, between forest stands dominated by C. nucifera (coconut palm) and forest stands with low abundance of C. nucifera. To assess litterfall damage we survey damage to both artiﬁcial seedlings (n = 711), outplanted real seedlings of two species (with and without protection via caging; n = 204), and standing rates of litterfall damage. We ﬁnd that rates of large-litterfall damage were an average of ﬁve times higher in sites with high densities of C. nucifera. Associated with these increases we observe that levels of physical damage to artiﬁcial model seedlings caused by litterfall over a 4-mo period increased from 4.9% in sites with low abundance of C. nucifera to 16.1% in sites with high abundance of C. nucifera. Extrapolated to annual rates, litterfall damage of this magnitude exceeds the average levels observed in other published studies. Living native seedlings also showed more than 300% higher levels of mortality in forest stands with high densities of C. nucifera, a difference that was greatly reduced when protected by caging from litterfall. In contrast, uncaged C. nucifera seedlings actually had slightly higher survivorship in habitats dominated by conspeciﬁcs. We suggest that litterfall damage may be an important mechanism by which this tropical palm reaches and maintains near monodominance in many coastal and insular habitats.","2014-05","2021-09-23 22:35:33","2021-09-23 22:35:33","2021-06-28 14:28:24","231-236","","3","30","","J.

GAs are unusually tractable for testing hypotheses about drivers of coral disease because of their pan-Pacific distributions, relatively high occurrence, and unambiguous ease of identification. We modeled multiple disease-environment associations that may underlie the prevalence of Acropora growth anomalies (AGA) (n = 304 surveys) and Porites growth anomalies (PGA) (n = 602 surveys) from across the Indo-Pacific. Nine predictor variables were modeled, including coral host abundance, human population size, and sea surface temperature and ultra-violet radiation anomalies. Prevalence of both AGAs and PGAs were strongly host density-dependent. PGAs additionally showed strong positive associations with human population size. Although this association has been widely posited, this is one of the first broad-scale studies unambiguously linking a coral disease with human population size. These results emphasize that individual coral diseases can show relatively distinct patterns of association with environmental predictors, even in similar diseases (growth anomalies) found on different host genera (Acropora vs. Porites). As human densities and environmental degradation increase globally, the prevalence of coral diseases like PGAs could increase accordingly, halted only perhaps by declines in host density below thresholds required for disease establishment.","2011-02-18","2021-09-23 22:35:33","2021-09-23 22:35:33","2021-06-28 14:28:37","e16887","","2","6","","PLoS ONE","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","Number: 2","","","https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0016887&type=printable","Animals,; Ecosystem,; Pacific Ocean,; Environment,; Population Density,; Animal Diseases/epidemiology,; Anthozoa/classification/growth & development,; Growth Disorders/epidemiology,; Human Activities/statistics & numerical data,; Humans,; Indian Ocean,; Prevalence","","Voolstra, Christian","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Until recently, little was known about benthic communities and, more specifically, algal abundance at Palmyra aside from species lists generated during 1916, 1955 and 1959 expeditions. Since 2000, NOAA’s Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center, Coral Reef Ecosystem Division has conducted six rapid ecological assessment surveys to monitor and gather baseline data for reefs surrounding Palmyra. Additionally, Scripps Institute of Oceanography documented benthic community structure on Palmyra’s reefs during a 2005 expedition. This study reports on the current state of knowledge for benthic community composition and algal community structure across the atoll. Benthic communities in fore reef areas (10 m depth) were dominated by reef builders (coral and crustose coralline algae) covering ~50% of the benthos, while turf algae, macroalgae, soft corals, and other invertebrates covered the remaining surfaces. Species of Halimeda, Lobophora, Dictyosphaeria, Galaxaura and Dichotomaria were among the 5 most common macroalgae recorded. Overall, the reef communities around Palmyra appear relatively healthy. Developing comprehensive species lists and continuing benthic monitoring will allow reef managers to detect ecosystem changes, including possible introduced and invasive species.","","2021-09-23 22:35:34","2021-09-23 22:35:34","","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There is also little information on whether changes in vegetation structure commonly associated with spatial variation in subsidies may play an important role in driving consumer responses to subsidies. To address these knowledge gaps, we studied changes in abundance, diet, trophic position, size, and body condition of two congeneric gecko species (Lepidodactylus spp.) that coexist in palm dominated and native (hereafter dicot dominated) forests across the Central Pacific. These forests differ strongly both in the amount of marine subsidies that they receive from seabird guano and carcasses, and in the physical structure of the habitat. Contrary to other studies, we found that subsidy level had no impact on the abundance of either gecko species; it also did not have any apparent effects on resource partitioning between species. However, it did affect body size, dietary composition, and trophic position of both species. Geckos in subsidized, dicot forests were larger, had higher body condition and more diverse diets, and occupied a much higher trophic position than geckos found in palm dominated, low subsidy level forests. Both direct variation in subsidy levels and associated changes in habitat structure appear to play a role in driving these responses. These results suggest that variation in subsidy levels may drive important behavioral responses in predators, even when their numerical response is limited. Strong changes in trophic position of consumers also suggest that subsidies may drive increasingly complex food webs, with longer overall food chain length.","2012-08-10","2021-09-23 22:35:34","2021-09-23 22:35:34","2021-06-28 14:29:01","e41364","","8","7","","PLoS ONE","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","Number: 8","","","","Animals,; Ecosystem,; Food Chain,; Female,; Male,; Body Size,; Lizards,; Population Dynamics,; Soil,; Trees","","Dornhaus, Anna","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we investigate the potential wide-scale distribution range in one marine sponge, Gelliodes wilsoni, that has been spread widely around the Pacific Rim by shipping. The species was originally described from the Philippines (western Pacific Ocean) by Wilson in 1925 as Gelliodes fibrosa. Recently, similar specimens have been collected from Guam (western Pacific Ocean), Hawaii, Palmyra Atoll (central Pacific Ocean), Acapulco Bay and Baja Peninsula (eastern Pacific Ocean). This species now appears to be widely distributed across the Pacific Ocean, and this distribution seems unlikely to have resulted from an extremely high dispersal capability; it is most likely the result of centuries of trans-Pacific shipping. We also propose the new name G. wilsoni for the species G. fibrosa originally described by Wilson because the same name was previously used by Dendy in 1905 to describe a species from Sri Lanka, which is morphologically different from the species described by Wilson. The case of G. wilsoni is not unique because several sponges (discussed here) have similar distribution patterns across the Pacific (at locations more than 10,000 km apart). This suggests an eastÁwest connectivity and that widespread distribution in sponges is indeed possible, albeit the result of human activities. In an increasingly connected world our research highlights the importance of understanding connectivity across oceanic scales in order to predict where invasive species are likely to occur.","2013-10","2021-09-23 22:35:34","2021-09-23 22:35:34","2021-06-28 14:29:09","768-775","","8","9","","Marine Biology Research","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","Number: 8","","","","coral-reefs,; hawaiian-islands,; porifera,; anthropogenic biogeography,; climate-change,; demospongiae,; human dispersal,; impact,; north-east atlantic,; oahu; pacific ocean,; records,; sponges,; transport,; widespread distribution,","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Spatially constrained grazing by herbivores, particularly parrotfishes, may foster coral recruitment by creating a spatially continuous refuge of bare substrate for settlement and survival. However, frequent bouts of concentrated feeding potentially remove newly settled corals. Understanding the frequency and intensity of parrotfish foraging behavior at appropriate scales (months and meters) is essential for connecting herbivory with benthic processes. We documented the foraging behavior of a large, mobile coral reef herbivore (the steephead parrotfish Chlorurus microrhinos) on Palmyra Atoll using various techniques (observational follows, fish surveys, and bite scar tracking) across 2 habitat states (one dominated by algal turfs, one dominated by live coral and crustose coralline algae) that are representative of reefs throughout the Central Pacific. Large differences in the abundance of a preferred resource were associated with major differences in feeding behavior. Where resources were abundant and regrew quickly, foraging areas were small and spatially focused, resulting in dense patches of bite scars (>100 bites m−2). Feeding behavior also showed a temporal periodicity, with individuals defending and regrazing the same area after regrowth occurred. In areas where resources were less abundant and recovered more slowly, parrotfish movements and foraging areas were significantly larger and bites were distributed sparsely across food patches. The large variability we observed within a single atoll suggests that characterizing species-specific foraging patterns from small-scale studies may not be appropriate.","2017-08-18","2021-09-23 22:35:34","2021-09-23 22:35:34","2021-06-28 14:29:12","165-176","","","577","","Mar.

"MDG5UE8S","journalArticle","","Clark, Oscar","THE RECENT CARBONATE SEDIMENTS OF PALMYRA ATOLL, NORTHERN LINE ISLANDS, CENTRAL PACIFIC OCEAN","","","","","http://hdl.handle.net/10063/1001","Palmyra Atoll is an isolated carbonate reef system located approximately 1600 km south of Hawaii in the northern Line Islands, central Pacific Ocean. Sediment samples from the lagoons and tidal zones were analyzed for grainsize and composition, and the results used to compile detailed maps and interpret the environments and lithofacies present. A distinct grainsize distribution was observed forming concentric bands ranging from coarse gravel rubble on the outer reef through to finer material in the interior of the atoll in the deep lagoons, where peloidal muds prevail. Five lithologic facies have been identified and typical sediments are poorly sorted and near-symmetrical in their grainsize distribution. On average, sediments are medium sand. A distinct chlorozoan assemblage was observed with coral and calcareous red algal fragments forming half of the sediment, with varying amounts of molluscs, Halimeda and foraminifera being the lesser major constituents. Lagoonal and tidal sediments showed little variation in composition between locations and lacked clear compositional zonation, characteristic of other larger atolls of the Pacific. Palmyra Atoll is unique in that it has had little human intervention for the last sixty years and as a result uninhibited natural processes are occurring. It is also unique in that it displays relatively deep for its size (<55 m), steep-sided compartmentalized lagoons that have abundant fine material (upward of 70% silt or finer), a feature not commonly observed at other Pacific atolls. This fine material has been identified as a peloidal mud and its mode and rate of deposition may be partly controlled by the abundant zooplankton in the lagoons. Recent sediments of Palmyra Atoll are almost entirely carbonate, originating from reef organisms inhabiting the atoll. The only other material is small amounts of siliceous sponge skeletons.","","2021-09-23 22:35:34","2021-09-23 22:35:34","","152","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The high precision of the U/Th method ( þ 1^2%) for dating young corals is well-established. Earlier studies have demonstrated the method’s accuracy for select samples of known age. However, these studies have focused on typical samples that have extremely low 232Th concentrations (tens of pg/ g). Here we study the dating systematics of young corals that have low but significant amounts of 232Th (up to 1000 pg/g), indicating the presence of small fractions of non-radiogenic 230Th (i.e. 230Th not generated by in situ U decay). We report U/Th ages for living and subaerially exposed fossil corals from Palmyra Island, located in the central tropical Pacific, that range from 50 to 700 yr old. The Palmyra corals contain varying amounts of 232Th and small fractions of associated non-radiogenic 230Th. Uncertainty associated with the correction for non-radiogenic 230Th can lead to significant errors in U/Th dates. We have characterized non-radiogenic 230Th/232Th values, (230Th/232Th)nr, as a means of minimizing this source of error. We calculate (230Th/232Th)nr values ranging from 0 to 2U1035 for the Palmyra living corals by comparing measured U/Th dates to absolute dates for the living coral, whose chronology is well-established. For the fossil corals, we employ three different approaches to arrive at (230Th/232Th)nr estimates. First, we compare measured U/Th dates to absolute dates in samples from a young fossil coral that overlaps the living coral. Next, we use the firm relative dating constraints imposed by five overlapping fossil corals from the 14th^15th centuries to calculate (230Th/232Th)nr values. Finally, we attempt to anchor the 14th^15th century floating coral chronology to an absolute chronology by correlating the climate signals in the coral records to those in absolutely dated climate proxy records. All lines of evidence point to a range of (230Th/232Th)nr for fossil corals that overlaps the range determined for the living coral, suggesting that most of the thorium is primary or is added while the coral is still alive. Our work also demonstrates the utility of multiple (230Th/232Th)nr estimates. Most importantly, we demonstrate a method by which accurate ( þ 5 yr) U/Th-based chronologies can be obtained for young fossil corals with significant 232Th concentrations.","2003-05","2021-09-23 22:35:34","2021-09-23 22:35:34","2021-06-28 14:29:22","91-103","","1-2","210","","Earth and Planetary Science Letters","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","Number: 1-2","","","","diagenesis,; sea,; atoll; carbonates,; mass-spectrometry,; systematics,; th-230 ages,; thorium,; uranium,","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Because many conservation actions require an understanding of the space use patterns of species of interest, there has been an increased effort in recent years to study the movement patterns and home range sizes of many herbivorous taxa. Also of great interest are the fine-scale foraging patterns of parrotfishes and the spatial and temporal scale of their interactions with benthic organisms. In this study, we performed a comprehensive evaluation of the movement patterns of the parrotfish Chlorurus microrhinos at multiple spatial and temporal scales at Palmyra Atoll in 2013−2015. We found that these fish have large home ranges when accounting for migrations to spawning and night refuge sites, but that within feeding territories, their activity is highly non-random and is quite spatially constrained and temporally episodic, indicating a high level of feeding selectivity. These patterns of foraging activity result in the patchy removal of algae from the reef, which may have consequences for the space competition between algae and corals.","2017-08-18","2021-09-23 22:35:34","2021-09-23 22:35:34","2021-06-28 14:29:40","149-164","","","577","","Mar.

These effects are not limited to the immediate physical damage, but can have widespread and lasting impacts due to alteration of the chemical makeup of the surrounding water column. This can subsequently impact the growth of benthic organisms, often leading to phase shifts and high levels of mortality of corals in the vicinity of the wreck. At Palmyra atoll, the grounding of a longline ﬁshing vessel on the shallow reef terrace is associated with a phase shift to the corallimorph, Rhodactis howesii. In 2013, a wreck removal effort initiated by the US Department of Fish and Wildlife resulted in the successful extraction and disposal of the wreckage, after which the density and percent cover of R. howesii in the immediate vicinity of the wreck site dropped precipitously. Here, we document the response of the ﬁsh community to the wreck removal and localized decline in R. howesii. We show that the biomass of scarid parrotﬁshes and acanthurid surgeonﬁshes and unicornﬁshes (primarily herbivores) increased after the removal of the wreck, while biomass of chaetodontid butterﬂyﬁshes (primarily invertivores, many species are known to feed on coelenterate polyps) declined over the study period. The density of small scarids and acanthurids also increased, but only after a few years post removal. Overall these results indicate that Palmyra’s unﬁshed herbivore population has rapidly responded to the removal of the wreck and associated decrease in corallimorph cover, can maintain high levels of grazing where space is made available for colonization of early successional algae species, and may have the potential to facilitate reef recovery.","2018-11-06","2021-09-23 22:35:34","2021-09-23 22:35:34","2021-06-28 14:29:43","406","","","5","","Front.

A combination of metagenomics, microscopy, culturing, and water chemistry were used to characterize microbial communities on four coral atolls in the Northern Line Islands, central Pacific. Kingman, a small uninhabited atoll which lies most northerly in the chain, had microbial and water chemistry characteristic of an open ocean ecosystem. On this atoll the microbial community was equally divided between autotrophs (mostly Prochlorococcus spp.) and heterotrophs. In contrast, Kiritimati, a large and populated (,5500 people) atoll, which is most southerly in the chain, had microbial and water chemistry characteristic of a near-shore environment. On Kiritimati, there were 10 times more microbial cells and virus-like particles in the water column and these microbes were dominated by heterotrophs, including a large percentage of potential pathogens. Culturable Vibrios were common only on Kiritimati. The benthic community on Kiritimati had the highest prevalence of coral disease and lowest coral cover. The middle atolls, Palmyra and Tabuaeran, had intermediate densities of microbes and viruses and higher percentages of autotrophic microbes than either Kingman or Kiritimati. The differences in microbial communities across atolls could reflect variation in 1) oceaonographic and/or hydrographic conditions or 2) human impacts associated with land-use and fishing. The fact that historically Kingman and Kiritimati did not differ strongly in their fish or benthic communities (both had large numbers of sharks and high coral cover) suggest an anthropogenic component in the differences in the microbial communities. Kingman is one of the world’s most pristine coral reefs, and this dataset should serve as a baseline for future studies of coral reef microbes. Obtaining the microbial data set, from atolls is particularly important given the association of microbes in the ongoing degradation of coral reef ecosystems worldwide.","2008-02-27","2021-09-23 22:35:34","2021-09-23 22:35:34","2021-06-28 14:29:50","e1584","","2","3","","PLoS ONE","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","Number: 2","","","","Animals,; Ecosystem,; Anthozoa/microbiology,; Geography,; Humans,; Animal Diseases/microbiology,; Marine Biology,; Water Microbiology; Water/chemistry,","","Ahmed, Niyaz","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Structural patterns reflect natural ecological processes that are not influenced by fishing or other anthropogenic factors. The most striking feature of this assemblage is an inverted biomass pyramid dominated by apex predators, primarily sharks and large snappers, across all depth and habitat strata examined. This pattern is most pronounced at greater depths (20 m) on the fore reef. Apex predators dominated to lesser extents in back-reef, patch-reef, and shallow fore-reef habitats. Prey assemblage size spectra showed fewer large prey and greater numbers of prey from small size classes at locations with greater piscivore biomass. Other patterns of prey abundance generally conformed to those previously observed at more commonly encountered, human-altered reefs (e.g. highest herbivore abundance on back reefs and shallower depths on the fore reefs; greater planktivore prevalence deeper on the fore reef). The latter patterns, however, inadvertently miss the less obvious differences in assemblage dynamics that result from alterations in the size structures of prey fish populations where apex predators have been heavily exploited or extirpated. The present study of a fully intact coral reef suggests that (1) piscivores are common across all habitats and depths, (2) the presence of predators does not lead to appreciable reductions in the biomass of other guilds, and (3) predators alter the size structure and therefore the potential productivity and energy flow of the ecosystem.","2010-07-14","2021-09-23 22:35:34","2021-09-23 22:35:34","2021-06-28 14:30:07","219-231","","","410","","Mar.

In August 2011 a storm originating in the Southern Ocean caused a large amplitude ocean swell to move northward through the Pacific Ocean. Its arrival at Palmyra Atoll coincided with transient elevated sea surface height and triggered turnover of the lagoon water column. This storm-induced change to the lagoon reflects long distance connectivity with propagated wave energy from the Southern Ocean and illustrates the increasing threats generated by climate change that are faced by human populations on most low-lying Pacific islands and atolls.","2014-01-31","2021-09-23 22:35:34","2021-09-23 22:35:34","2021-06-28 14:30:17","e87971","","1","9","","PLoS ONE","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","Number: 1","","","","Pacific Islands,; Climate Change,; Cyclonic Storms,; Pacific Ocean","","Chapman, Maura (Gee) Geraldine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we reconstructed the inter-annual variability in central equatorial Pacific surface water ∆14C from 1922–1956 using near-monthly 14C measurements in a Porites sp. coral skeleton (FI5A) from the windward side of Fanning Island (3°54′32″N, 159°18′88″W). The most pronounced feature in this record is a large, positive shift in the ∆14C between 1947 and 1956 that coincides with the switch of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) from a positive to a negative phase in the mid-1940s. Although the absolute ∆14C values from 1950–1955 in FI5A differ from the ∆14C values of another coral core collected from the opposite side of the island, both records show a large, positive shift in their ∆14C records at that time. The relative increase in the ∆14C of each record is consistent with the premise that a common mechanism is controlling the ∆14C records within each coral record. Overall, the Fanning ∆14C data support the notion that a significant amount of subtropical seawater is arriving at the Equator, but does not allow us to determine the mechanism for its transport.","2003","2021-09-23 22:35:35","2021-09-23 22:35:35","2021-06-28 14:30:33","91-99","","1","45","","Radiocarbon","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","Number: 1","","","","circulation,; el-nino,; climate variability,; north pacific,; ocean,; radiocarbon,; south-pacific,; temperature variability,; thermocline; tropical pacific,","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Working on a remote predator-dominated coral reef on Palmyra Atoll, USA, we used behavioral foraging observations to quantify the roles of common parrotfish and surgeonfish in the roving herbivore guild. We recorded species-specific bite rates on different benthic organisms, quantified the relative abundance of those benthic organisms, and estimated benthos-specific grazing intensities as a function of bite rates, fish abundance, and percent cover. These grazing metrics were compared between the exposed fore reef (~10 m depth) and protected reef terrace (~5 m depth) habitats. We observed large differences in feeding rates and substrate selectivity among fish species. Most species fed predominately on algal turfs; however, some species foraged broadly among fleshy macroalgal taxa, while others specialized on calcified green algae of the genus Halimeda. The highest bite rates were recorded from species targeting algal turfs, while the highest rates of defecation were recorded from species targeting Halimeda. Per capita bite rates of all species were higher in the fore reef habitat (mean 45% more bites min−1); however, overall grazing intensities on turf algae (bites cm−2 d−1) were 5 times higher on the reef terrace than on the fore reef. Despite habitat-specific differences in the herbivore assemblages, the estimated distribution of total bites showed consistency among habitats, with strong guild-level positive foraging selectivity for algal turf. Comparisons of bite and defecation rate data for these herbivores across the Indo-Pacific highlight phylogenetic constraints on grazing activities.

In 2003, we surveyed terrestrial arthropods to document extant native and introduced species richness, compare these lists with historical records, and assess potential threats to native species and ecosystem integrity. In total, 115 arthropod taxa were collected, bringing the total number of taxa recorded since 1913 to 162. Few native species were collected; most taxa were accidental introductions also recorded from the Hawaiian Islands, the presumed main source of introductions to Palmyra. The overlap with previous historical surveys in 1913 and 1948 was low (<40%), and new species continue to establish, with one species of whiteﬂy reaching pest status between 2003 and 2005. We observed numerous dead or dying large Pisonia grandis, and the green scale Pulvinaria urbicola (Coccidae) was particularly abundant on trees of poor health. Abundant introduced ants, particularly Pheidole megacephala, tended this and other hemipterans feeding on both native and introduced plants. We hypothesize that the Pheidole-Pulvinaria facultative mutualism is causing the decline of Pisonia grandis. Because of the unique properties of Pisonia grandis forest on oceanic atolls, its importance for nesting seabirds, and its alarming global decline, immediate conservation efforts should be directed at controlling introduced Hemiptera and disrupting their mutualisms with nonnative ants on Palmyra Atoll.","2007-10","2021-09-23 22:35:35","2021-09-23 22:35:35","2021-06-28 14:30:41","485-502","","4","61","","Pacific Science","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","Number: 4","","","","biological invasions,; impact; rain-forest,; ant,; consequences,; homogenization,; pheidole-megacephala,","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While perturbation studies, in the form of incubations under elevated pCO2, reveal sensitivities and responses of individual species, one missing link in the OA story results from a chronic lack of pH data specific to a given species’ natural habitat. Here, we present a compilation of continuous, high-resolution time series of upper ocean pH, collected using autonomous sensors, over a variety of ecosystems ranging from polar to tropical, open-ocean to coastal, kelp forest to coral reef. These observations reveal a continuum of month-long pH variability with standard deviations from 0.004 to 0.277 and ranges spanning 0.024 to 1.430 pH units. The nature of the observed variability was also highly site-dependent, with characteristic diel, semi-diurnal, and stochastic patterns of varying amplitudes. These biome-specific pH signatures disclose current levels of exposure to both high and low dissolved CO2, often demonstrating that resident organisms are already experiencing pH regimes that are not predicted until 2100. Our data provide a first step toward crystallizing the biophysical link between environmental history of pH exposure and physiological resilience of marine organisms to fluctuations in seawater CO2. Knowledge of this spatial and temporal variation in seawater chemistry allows us to improve the design of OA experiments: we can test organisms with a priori expectations of their tolerance guardrails, based on their natural range of exposure. Such hypothesis-testing will provide a deeper understanding of the effects of OA. Both intuitively simple to understand and powerfully informative, these and similar comparative time series can help guide management efforts to identify areas of marine habitat that can serve as refugia to acidification as well as areas that are particularly vulnerable to future ocean change.","2011-12-19","2021-09-23 22:35:35","2021-09-23 22:35:35","2021-06-28 14:30:46","e28983","","12","6","","PLoS ONE","High-Frequency Dynamics of Ocean pH","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","Number: 12","","","","Ecosystem,; Time Factors; Oceans and Seas,; Seawater/chemistry,; Aquatic Organisms,; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration,","","Chin, Wei-Chun","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The application of this method to living slow-growing colonies from a range of sites as well as the observations of axial growth patterns in thin sections of their skeletons oﬀer the ﬁrst expanded and well constrained data on longevity, growth pattern and mean growth rates in E. rostrata. Absolute dated specimens indicate life spans of colonies ranging from 209 ± 8 yrs to 605 ± 7 yrs with radial growth rates from 0.012 to 0.072 mm yrÀ1 and vertical extension rates from 0.6 to 1.9 mm yrÀ1. The linear growth rates reported here are lower than those reported for other deep-sea scleractinian corals (Lophelia pertusa and Madrepora oculata). The U-series dating indicates that the growth ring patterns of E. rostrata are not consistent with annual periodicity emphasizing the importance of absolute radiometric dating methods to constrain growth rates. Slow accretion and extreme longevity make this species and its habitat especially vulnerable to disturbances and impacts from human activities. This dating method combined with observation of growth patterns opens up new perspectives in the ﬁeld of deep-sea corals since it can provide quantitative estimates of growth rates and longevity of deep-sea corals in general.","2010-04","2021-09-23 22:35:35","2021-09-23 22:35:35","2021-06-28 14:30:49","2380-2395","","8","74","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta","Uranium-series dating and growth characteristics of the deep-sea scleractinian coral","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","Number: 8","","","","annual periodicity,; cold-water corals,; collector mass-spectrometry,; desmophyllum-cristagalli,; gorgonian corals,; isotope ratios,; lophelia-pertusa,; mediterranean-sea,; northeast atlantic,; primnoa-resedaeformis,","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The atoll is unusual in that it was heavily altered during WWII resulting in an atypical lagoon system. We conducted surveys at both 6-8m and 12-14m at 3 sites at the atoll and recorded sponge densities, area cover and available substrate for the 29 species found at these sites. Multivariate analysis of sponge densities and area cover revealed significant variability in sponge assemblages between both site and depth. Univariate analysis also showed significant differences in area cover between depths, but not between sites. Diversity indices and the average number of species at each site showed an increase in diversity across lagoons from West to East. This study indicates that despite the small size of the atoll, depth is a factor that shapes sponge assemblages at Palmyra Atoll. The heavy alterations to the lagoon, particularly the area near the channel entrance may be influencing the sponge assemblage structure, however, other environmental variables still need to be investigated.","2010-10-12","2021-09-23 22:35:35","2021-09-23 22:35:35","2021-06-28 14:30:52","26-30","","1","4","","TOMBJ","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","Number: 1","","","","Palmyra Atoll,; Central Pacific,; depth,; flow rate; sedimentation,; Sponge,","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We found 24 sponge species in permanent quadrats in the lagoon between 2009 and 2011, and 11 species on our recruitment panels. The sponge assemblage composition and abundance did not vary signiﬁcantly between years and appear stable. Many sponge recruits were found in both years that the panels were examined although higher rates were recorded in the second year of the study. While it seems very possible that a change to a sponge-dominated lagoon is associated with declining environmental quality at Palmyra as a result of modiﬁcations over 70 years ago, without pre-modiﬁcation data on reef assemblage composition this remains speculative. Our observations of short-term temporal stability in the sponge assemblages at Palmyra highlight the potential for sponge-dominated reef states to be maintained in degraded reef environments that are seemingly unsuitable for coral survival.","2016-10","2021-09-23 22:35:35","2021-09-23 22:35:35","2021-06-28 14:31:04","1147-1153","","5","37","","Mar Ecol","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","Number: 5","","","","communities,; coral-reefs,; atoll,; coral reef,; abundance,; diversity,; pacific ocean,; lagoon,; phase shift,; sponge,; states","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Both lethal and non-lethal (i.e. behavioral) effects of predators on prey are well documented. However, observations of apparent predator–prey interactions between the piscivorous twinspot snapper Lutjanus bohar and the herbivorous surgeonfish Acanthurus triostegus suggest that the nature of their association may be context-dependent. The context-dependent nature of some species interactions is well-known, and in some cases a single species has been shown to act as both predator and facilitator to its prey. We present incidental in situ observations suggesting that, in the context of voraciously grazing schools of A. triostegus, this species pair may also engage in a facultative mutualistic relationship. Specifically, we propose that within this context, both species may indirectly derive a benefit through changes in the behavior and/or density of territorial damselfishes driven by both L. bohar and A. triostegus. We provide prescriptions for rigorously testing this hypothesis and suggest that re-evaluation of this, and possibly other, ostensibly exclusive predator–prey pairs in marine systems may reveal unexpected relationships. Given the relative lack of examples of such interactions involving the same predator acting as both facilitator and predator from marine versus terrestrial systems, coupled with this preliminary evidence, we propose that this topic is ripe for exploration.","2011-06-09","2021-09-23 22:35:35","2021-09-23 22:35:35","2021-06-28 14:31:23","299-302","","","431","","Mar.

Fishing disproportionately removes larger, predatory ﬁshes from marine food webs. Most studies of the consequent indirect effects focus on density-mediated interactions where predator removal alternately drives increases and decreases in abundances of successively lower trophic-level species. While prey may increase in number with fewer predators, they may also alter their behavior. When such behavioral responses impact the food resources of prey species, behaviorally mediated trophic cascades can dramatically shape landscapes. It remains unclear whether this pathway of change is typically triggered by ocean ﬁshing. By coupling a simple foraging model with empirical observations from coral reefs, we provide a mechanistic basis for understanding and predicting how predator harvest can alter the landscape of risk for herbivores and consequently drive dramatic changes in primary producer distributions. These results broaden trophic cascade predictions for ﬁsheries to include behavioral changes. They also provide a framework for detecting the presence and magnitude of behaviorally mediated cascades.

Empirical and theoretical results suggest that (1) survey method selection has a strong impact on the estimates of shark density that are produced, (2) standardizations by survey duration are needed to properly interpret and compare survey outputs, (3) increasing survey size does not necessarily increase survey precision, and (4) methods that yield the highest density estimates are not always the most accurate.

Our results indicate that three of Palmyra’s most abundant large predators (e.g., two reef sharks and one snapper) use resources from different habitats creating important linkages across ecosystems. Observations of cross-system foraging such as this have important implications for the understanding of ecosystem functioning, the management of large-predator populations, and the design of conservation measures intended to protect whole ecosystems.

Uncertainty remains, however, about whether predators can influence patterns of temporal niche construction at ecologically relevant timescales. Partitioning of time is an important mechanism by which prey avoid interactions with predators. However, the traits that control a prey organism’s capacity to operate during a particular portion of the diel cycle are diverse and complex. Thus, diel prey niches are often assumed to be relatively unlikely to respond to changes in predation risk at short timescales. Here we present evidence to the contrary. We report results that suggest that the anthropogenic depletion of daytime active predators (species that are either diurnal or cathemeral) in a coral reef ecosystem is associated with rapid temporal niche expansions in a multi-species assemblage of nocturnal prey fishes. Diurnal comparisons of nocturnal prey fish abundance in predator rich and predator depleted reefs at two atolls revealed that nocturnal fish were approximately six (biomass) and eight (density) times more common during the day on predator depleted reefs. Amongst these, the prey species that likely were the most specialized for nocturnal living, and thus the most vulnerable to predation (i.e. those with greatest eye size to body length ratio), showed the strongest diurnal increases at sites where daytime active predators were rare. While we were unable to determine whether these observed increases in diurnal abundance by nocturnal prey were the result of a numerical or behavioral response, either effect could be ecologically significant. These results raise the possibility that predation may play an important role in regulating the partitioning of time by prey and that anthropogenic depletions of predators may be capable of causing rapid changes to key properties of temporal community architecture.","2012-06-13","2021-09-23 22:35:35","2021-09-23 22:35:35","2021-06-28 14:31:56","e38871","","6","7","","PLoS ONE","Night Shift","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","Number: 6","","","","Animals,; Fishes/physiology,; Darkness,; Predatory Behavior","","Gursky-Doyen, Sharon","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this discussion we draw examples from two model remote sites: Palmyra and Tabuaeran Atolls. Spatial analyses conducted using population density as a proxy for remoteness indicate that many existing recognized protected areas already include remote regions, but that the vast majority of the overall remote zones on the planet are not yet formally protected.

It has been proposed that their presence is necessary for positively shaping the structure and functioning of ecosystems. We evaluated this hypothesis using the case of the world’s largest parrotfish (Bolbometopon muricatum), a globally imperiled species. We used direct observation, animal tracking, and computer simulations to examine the diverse routes through which B. muricatum affects the diversity, dispersal, relative abundance, and survival of the corals that comprise the foundation of reef ecosystems. Our results suggest that this species can influence reef building corals in both positive and negative ways. Field observation and simulation outputs indicated that B. muricatum reduced the abundance of macroalgae that can outcompete corals, but they also feed directly on corals, decreasing coral abundance, diversity, and colony size. B. muricatum appeared to facilitate coral advancement by mechanically dispersing coral fragments and opening up bare space for coral settlement, but they also damaged adult corals and remobilized a large volume of potentially stressful carbonate sediment. The impacts this species has on reefs appears to be regulated in part by its abundance—the effects of B. muricatum were more intense in simulation scenarios populated with high densities of these fish. Observations conducted in regions with high and low predator (e.g., sharks) abundance generated results that are consistent with the hypothesis that these predators of B. muricatum may play a role in governing their abundance; thus, predation may modulate the intensity of the effects they have on reef dynamics. Overall our results illustrate that functionally unique and threatened species may not have universally positive impacts on ecosystems and that it may be necessary for environmental managers to consider the diverse effects of such species and the forces that mediate the strength of their influence.","2014-10","2021-09-23 22:35:35","2021-09-23 22:35:35","2021-06-28 14:32:06","1312-1321","","5","28","","Conservation Biology","Positive and Negative Effects of a Threatened Parrotfish on Reef Ecosystems","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","Number: 5","","","","Animals,; management,; Models, Biological,; Coral Reefs,; Food Chain,; Conservation of Natural Resources,; diversity,; coral,; benthic,; Bentico,; Bolbometopon,; diversidad,; Endangered Species,; especie amenazada,; Feeding Behavior,; funcion,; function,; manejo,; Perciformes/physiology,; Polynesia,; simulacion,; simulation,; threatened species","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here high-resolution acoustic cameras are demonstrated as effective tools to study the ecology and behavior of reef and coastal sharks that operate in the vicinity of a near-pristine coral reef atoll. The acoustic camera generated detailed imagery and size measurements from N 1000 sightings of sharks that traversed a discrete corridor linking two of the atoll's distinct marine habitats, the forereef and offshore pelagic habitat with the atoll's lagoon. Daily shark density and estimated biomass values varied considerably through time, but generally approximated values calculated using less comprehensive and more labor-intensive techniques at this same atoll. Diel patterns in shark movements revealed elevated shark presence during low-light periods of the day (e.g. peak sighting density just after dusk), but weaker links between shark movement patterns and tides. Data gathered through use of this tool extends and reinforces some of the observations made of smaller numbers of sharks using traditional data collection methods while providing unique additional insights into the ways that larger numbers of sharks operate at ﬁne spatial scales over longer periods of time. Behavioral information of this type is critical to developing effective management plans for these vulnerable species.","2016-09","2021-09-23 22:35:35","2021-09-23 22:35:35","2021-06-28 14:32:10","128-133","","","482","","Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","marine protected areas,; palmyra atoll,; behavior,; conservation; ocean,; islands,; movement patterns,; sharks,; acoustic camera,; ecosystem,; frequency,; identification sonar didson,; mobile species,; movement ecology,; sonar,; tomales bay,","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Palmyra Atoll National Wildlife Refuge, one of the Northern Line Islands in the Central Pacific, contains a regionally significant green turtle Chelonia mydas foraging ground. Residency patterns of this species were investigated through satellite telemetry (n = 15 males, 1 female, 2 subadults) and flipper tagging (n = 555) between 2008 and 2013. Almost every captured turtle was flipper-tagged, but telemetry efforts focused primarily on adult males, which have been studied infrequently. Overall, the turtles tracked during 4076 transmission days (mean = 227, range = 37 to 633) had high site fidelity and small home ranges, and remained close to their capture sites in waters ≤50 m deep. Five turtles were tracked for >1 yr, but none left Palmyra on annual breeding migrations. Only one satellite-tracked turtle departed the atoll, covering a total distance of ~5600 km in a near-circular loop. Similarly, flipper tag recaptures on the atoll (n = 67) occurred near the original capture site. However, additional tags were recovered from 1 female in Kiritimati, Northern Line Islands, and from 1 subadult in Kosrae, Micronesia, ~690 and 3800 km away from Palmyra, respectively. Such extended, spatially restricted residency with low turnover is expected in small, high-quality habitats. The study highlights the importance of this protected area, which harbors regionally endangered turtles whose movements over several years are almost entirely encompassed within its established boundaries.","2018-10-29","2021-09-23 22:35:36","2021-09-23 22:35:36","2021-06-28 14:32:22","165-182","","","37","","Endang.

While corals in American Samoa show more stress-tolerant symbionts, this region does not exhibit higher sea surface temperatures, a greater record of heating anomalies or more bleaching than the other 3 regions. That these local patterns do not hold regionally suggests the importance of other factors, including host responses, other environmental correlates, within-clade physiological diversity and dispersal limitation, in driving the distribution of coral symbionts.","2009-03-12","2021-09-23 22:35:36","2021-09-23 22:35:36","2021-06-28 14:32:28","93-103","","","378","","Mar.

Many marine ectothermic predators behave like CPF animals, but never stop swimming, suggesting that predators will incur ‘travelling’ costs while resting. Currently, it is unknown how these CPF predators behave or how modulation of behavior contributes to daily energy budgets. We combine acoustic telemetry, multi-sensor loggers, and hidden Markov models (HMMs) to generate ‘activity seascapes’, which combine space use with patterns of activity, for reef sharks (blacktip reef and grey reef sharks) at an unfished Pacific atoll. Results: Sharks of both species occupied a central place during the day within deeper, cooler water where they were less active, and became more active over a larger area at night in shallower water. However, video cameras on two grey reef sharks revealed foraging attempts/success occurring throughout the day, and that multiple sharks were refuging in common areas. A simple bioenergetics model for grey reef sharks predicted that diel changes in energy expenditure are primarily driven by changes in swim speed and not body temperature. Conclusions: We provide a new method for simultaneously visualizing diel space use and behavior in marine predators, which does not require the simultaneous measure of both from each animal. We show that blacktip and grey reef sharks behave as CPFs, with diel changes in activity, horizontal and vertical space use. However, aspects of their foraging behavior may differ from other predictions of traditional CPF models. In particular, for species that never stop swimming, patch foraging times may be unrelated to patch travel distance.","2018-12","2021-09-23 22:35:36","2021-09-23 22:35:36","2021-06-28 14:32:32","9","","1","6","","Mov Ecol","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","Number: 1","","","","Coral reefs,; Acceleration,; Foraging,; Hidden Markov models,; Sharks,; Telemetry","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Sharks in the Palmyra lagoons have relatively small home ranges and appear to obtain most of their energy from the lagoon ecosystem. Sharks showed low levels of migration between lagoons over periods of several years, and individuals in the larger western lagoon tended to have longer residence times than those in the smaller eastern lagoon. Furthermore, for sharks in the western lagoon, there was no relationship between total length (TL) and δ15N, 13C relative isotope concentrations, or a Body Condition index (BC). For sharks in the eastern lagoon, TL was positively related to δ15N and negatively related to δ13C and BC. These results suggest that there are low levels of mixing of sharks between lagoons, and these are leading to differences in trophic ecology and potentially foraging success. Although the causative factors behind these differences are unknown, shark home range location can potentially lead to variation in trophic ecology, even over small spatial scales.","2010-04","2021-09-23 22:35:36","2021-09-23 22:35:36","2021-06-28 14:32:41","94-102","","1-2","386","","Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","Number: 1-2","","","","northern line islands,; palmyra atoll,; foraging ecology,; pacific,; size,; fish,; reef sharks,; acoustic telemetry,; assumptions,; enrichment,; habitat quality,; isotopes,; marine protected area,; models,; satellite telemetry,; stable isotopes,; success","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We utilized correlated random walk (CRW), fractal, and first passage time (FPT) analysis to quantify the response of planktivorous manta rays Manta alfredi to spatial scale and identify locations of ARS within lagoons at Palmyra Atoll. Mantas used CRWs at small spatial scales to move between prey patches, but not at larger scales as they performed home-ranging behavior. One domain was located with straighter movements at scales < 330 m, and more tortuous movements at scales > 330 m. ARS was located adjacent to ledges with high abundance of plankton, or within channels.

For ectothermic predators, ambient temperature may also influence daily routines through its effects on physiological performance. Temperatures can fluctuate significantly over the diel cycle and ectotherms may synchronize behaviour to match thermal regimes in order to optimize fitness. We used bio-logging to quantify activity and body temperature of blacktip reef sharks (Carcharhinus melanopterus) at a tropical atoll. Behavioural observations were used to concurrently measure bite rates in herbivorous reef fishes, as an index of activity for potential diurnal prey. Sharks showed early evening peaks in activity, particularly during ebbing high tides, while body temperatures peaked several hours prior to the period of maximal activity. Herbivores also displayed peaks in activity several hours earlier than the peaks in shark activity. Sharks appeared to be least active while their body temperatures were highest and most active while temperatures were cooling, although we hypothesize that due to thermal inertia they were still warmer than their smaller prey during this period. Sharks may be most active during early evening periods as they have a sensory advantage under low light conditions and/or a thermal advantage over cooler prey. Sharks swam into shallow water during daytime low tide periods potentially to warm up and increase rates of digestion before the nocturnal activity period, which may be a strategy to maximize ingestion rates. “Hunt warm, rest warmer” may help explain the early evening activity seen in other ectothermic predators.","2015-06-10","2021-09-23 22:35:36","2021-09-23 22:35:36","2021-06-28 14:32:50","e0127807","","6","10","","PLoS ONE","Drivers of Daily Routines in an Ectothermic Marine Predator","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","Number: 6","","","","Animals,; Ecosystem,; Sharks/physiology,; Predatory Behavior,; Female,; Circadian Rhythm,; Digestion,; Rest,; Temperature","","Tsikliras, Athanassios C.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, linking competitive interactions to predator distribution patterns is difficult and theoretical models predict different habitat selection patterns dependent on habitat quality and how competition manifests itself. While models generally consider competitors to be either equal in ability, or for one phenotype to have a fixed advantage over the other, few studies consider that an animal may only have a competitive advantage in specific habitats. We used  10 years of telemetry data, habitat surveys and behavioral experiments, to show spatial partitioning between and within two species of reef shark (grey reef Carcharhinus amblyrhinchos and blacktip reef sharks C. melanopterus) at an unfished Pacific atoll. Within a species, sharks remained within small ‘sub-habitats’ with very few movements of individuals between sub-habitats, which previous models have suggested could be caused by intra-specific competition. Blacktip reef sharks were more broadly distributed across habitat types but a greater proportion used lagoon and backreef habitats, while grey reef sharks preferred forereef habitats. Grey reef sharks at a nearby atoll where blacktip reef sharks are absent, were distributed more broadly between habitat types than when both species were present. A series of individual-based models predict that habitat separation would only arise if there are competitive interactions between species that are habitat-specific, with grey reefs having a competitive advantage on the forereefs and blacktips in the lagoons and backreef. We provide compelling evidence that competition helps drive distribution patterns and spatial separation of a marine predator community, and highlight that competitive advantages may not be constant but rather dependent on habitats.","2018-06","2021-09-23 22:35:36","2021-09-23 22:35:36","2021-06-28 14:32:54","767-779","","6","127","","Oikos","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","Number: 6","","","","competition,; movement,; telemetry","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent OA studies have demonstrated negative and/or differential effects of reduced pH on growth, development, calcification and physiology, but most of these have focused on taxa other than calcareous benthic macroalgae. Here we investigate the potential effects of OA on one of the most common coral reef macroalgal genera, Halimeda. Species of Halimeda produce a large proportion of the sand in the tropics and are a major contributor to framework development on reefs because of their rapid calcium carbonate production and high turnover rates. On Palmyra Atoll in the central Pacific, we conducted a manipulative bubbling experiment to investigate the potential effects of OA on growth, calcification and photophysiology of 2 species of Halimeda. Our results suggest that Halimeda is highly susceptible to reduced pH and aragonite saturation state but the magnitude of these effects is species specific. H. opuntia suffered net dissolution and 15% reduction in photosynthetic capacity, while H. taenicola did not calcify but did not alter photophysiology in experimental treatments. The disparate responses of these species to elevated CO2 partial pressure (pCO2) may be due to anatomical and physiological differences and could represent a shift in their relative dominance in the face of OA. The ability for a species to exert biological control over calcification and the species specific role of the carbonate skeleton may have important implications for the potential effects of OA on ecological function in the future.","2011-10-28","2021-09-23 22:35:36","2021-09-23 22:35:36","2021-06-28 14:33:03","67-78","","","440","","Mar.

This circulation was stronger for larger, directly incident waves and low alongshore ﬂow conditions, consistent with predictions from modeling. Favorable forcing conditions must be maintained on the order of 1 h to accelerate and develop the SAG circulation cells. The primary cross and alongshore depth-averaged momentum balances were between the pressure gradient, radiation stress gradient, and nonlinear convective terms, and the bottom drag was similar to values found on other reefs. The vertical structure of these circulation cells was previously unknown and the results show a complex horizontal offshore Lagrangian ﬂow over the spurs near the surface driven by alongshore variability in radiation stress gradients.

Shallow terrace and backreef sites with high coral cover (> 50%) had a highly variable temperature distributions, but their average weekly temperature distributions were lower and similar to offshore waters. The mechanism for maintaining this low weekly temperature was mean advection, which varied on a weekly timescale in response to wave forcing. Tides were also important in driving ﬂow on the atoll, but their contribution to the net transport of heat was not signiﬁcant. Wind and regional forcing were generally not important in driving ﬂow inside the atoll. Buoyancy-driven ﬂows were important within the lagoons, and in driving cross-shore exchange on forereef environments.

In demographic surveys, small juvenile corals are often grouped with larger and older corals or overlooked entirely due to their small size and cryptic nature. This study describes the distribution, abundance, and microhabitat of small juvenile corals, defined as post-settlement corals ≤5 mm in diameter, at Palmyra Atoll, Central Pacific. A diver-operated pulsating blue light and filter system was used to enhance innate coral fluorescence during daylight to aid in detecting small juvenile corals. Juvenile densities ranged from 0 to 59.5 m–2 and were more than 9 times higher on the fore reef (21.9 ± 0.8 m–2) than on the back reef (2.4 ± 0.3 m–2). The highest juvenile densities were observed in the middle of the sampled range at 14 m depth on the fore reef. Juvenile corals accounted for > 31% of coral colonies in all habitats and depths, which resulted in positively skewed size-frequency distributions. The microhabitat of juvenile corals on coral rubble was best described as a convex surface covered with crustose coralline algae that lacked another coral within a 20 mm radius. This study provides basic ecology and natural history information of small juvenile corals and shows the feasibility of surveying corals ≤5 mm in diameter as a method for monitoring coral populations and assessing environmental changes on a coral reef.","2009-02-11","2021-09-23 22:35:36","2021-09-23 22:35:36","2021-06-28 14:33:28","133-142","","","376","","Mar.

Most coral reefs are moderately to severely degraded by local human activities such as fishing and pollution as well as global change, hence it is difficult to separate local from global effects. To this end, we surveyed coral reefs on uninhabited atolls in the northern Line Islands to provide a baseline of reef community structure, and on increasingly populated atolls to document changes associated with human activities. We found that top predators and reef-building organisms dominated unpopulated Kingman and Palmyra, while small planktivorous fishes and fleshy algae dominated the populated atolls of Tabuaeran and Kiritimati. Sharks and other top predators overwhelmed the fish assemblages on Kingman and Palmyra so that the biomass pyramid was inverted (top-heavy). In contrast, the biomass pyramid at Tabuaeran and Kiritimati exhibited the typical bottom-heavy pattern. Reefs without people exhibited less coral disease and greater coral recruitment relative to more inhabited reefs. Thus, protection from overfishing and pollution appears to increase the resilience of reef ecosystems to the effects of global warming.","2008-02-27","2021-09-23 22:35:36","2021-09-23 22:35:36","2021-06-28 14:33:31","e1548","","2","3","","PLoS ONE","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","Number: 2","","","","Animals,; Ecosystem,; Geography,; Fishes,; Conservation of Natural Resources,; Biomass,; Anthozoa,; Greenhouse Effect,; Eukaryota,; Water Pollutants","","Ahmed, Niyaz","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

When coral and algae were placed in chambers together but separated by a 0.02 lm filter, corals suffered 100% mortality. With the addition of the broad-spectrum antibiotic ampicillin, mortality was completely prevented. Physiological measurements showed complementary patterns of increasing coral stress with proximity to algae.

These indices, along with the absence of observed fibropapilloma tumors, indicated that turtles at Palmyra Atoll were on average in very good condition. We also conducted 11 relative abundance surveys from 2005 to 2011, a subset of which revealed an uneven distribution of turtles around Palmyra Atoll with 3 hot spots of turtle abundance off the flats to the north, south, and east. By linking several aspects of our research program with similar efforts at foraging grounds throughout the Pacific Basin, we can further our understanding of poorly known regional migratory connectivity.","2013-07","2021-09-23 22:35:36","2021-09-23 22:35:36","2021-06-28 14:33:44","2-16","","1","12","","Chelonian Conservation and Biology","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","Number: 1","","","","coral-reefs,; hawaiian-islands,; northern line islands,; palmyra atoll,; baja-california,; body condition,; chelonia mydas,; chelonia-mydas,; conservation threats,; eastern pacific green turtle,; eretmochelys imbricata,; fibropapillomatosis,; foraging,; green sea-turtles,; hawksbill turtle,; herpes virus,; mexico,; population; relative abundance,; reptilia,; testudines,","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using comparative ﬁeld surveys of ﬁsh on protected and exploited reefs in three oceans and the Mediterranean Sea, we show that exploitation consistently depresses the slope of the SAR for both power-law and exponential models. The magnitude of change appears to be proportional to ﬁshing intensity. Results are independent of taxonomic resolution and robust across coral and rocky reefs, sampling protocols and statistical methods. Changes in species richness, relative abundance and patch occupancy all appear to contribute to this pattern. We conclude that exploitation pressure impacts the fundamental scaling of biodiversity as well as the species richness and spatial distribution patterns of reef ﬁsh.

To determine the value of the humphead wrasse as an umbrella species for coral reef conservation, we conducted a multi-year study of humphead wrasse home range at Palmyra Atoll, Central Tropical Pacific, tagging juvenile, female, and male individuals with acoustic transmitters. We quantified home range using 2 metrics, length and area, and determined if these metrics were related to the sex and maturity status of the individual. We recorded individual movements during 5030 fishdays, yielding detailed records for 14 individuals comprising 3 juveniles, 5 females, and 6 males. The home range of humphead wrasse measured over a 2 yr study was 0.4 to 14 km and changed with ontogeny. Females had larger home ranges than other reef fishes studied to date (n = 68), indicating value as an umbrella species for coral reefs. We compared the home range of the species to the size distribution of tropical marine protected areas (MPAs), and used a model to estimate the MPA length necessary to retain humphead wrasse.

We assessed the capacity of a large MPA to conserve grey reef sharks - a Near Threatened species with a widespread distribution and poorly understood offshore movement patterns - using a combination of conventional tags, satellite tags, and an emerging vessel tracking technology. We found that the 54,000 km2 U.S. Palmyra Atoll National Wildlife Refuge in the central Paciﬁc Ocean provides substantial protection for grey reef sharks, as two-thirds of satellite-tracked sharks remained within MPA boundaries for the entire study duration. Additionally, our analysis of N0.5 million satellite detections of commercial ﬁshing vessels identiﬁed virtually no ﬁshing effort within the refuge and signiﬁcant effort beyond the MPA perimeter, suggesting that large MPAs can effectively beneﬁt reef sharks and other mobile species if properly enforced. However, our results also highlight limitations of place-based conservation as some of these reef-associated sharks moved surprising distances into pelagic waters (up to 926 km from Palmyra Atoll, 810 km beyond MPA boundaries). Small-scale ﬁshermen operating beyond MPA boundaries (up to 366 km from Palmyra) captured 2% of sharks that were initially tagged at Palmyra, indicating that large MPAs provide substantial, though incomplete, protection for reef sharks.","2017-03","2021-09-23 22:35:37","2021-09-23 22:35:37","2021-06-28 14:34:08","64-71","","","207","","Biological Conservation","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","marine protected areas,; ocean,; movement patterns,; satellite telemetry,; automatic identification system,; carcharhinus amblyrhynchos,; carcharhinus-amblyrhynchos,; declines,; fisheries,; overlap; reserve networks,; sea-turtles,; tracking,; vessel tracking,","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

WWII military construction impacted the atoll, and lagoon restoration has been proposed to facilitate reef recovery. A total of 84 coral species/morphological groups representing 31 genera were recorded during 2007 surveys at Palmyra. Significant differences in relative coral community structure were detected between reef types (back reef, fore reef) and among individual sites (5 back reef, 6 fore reef) around the atoll. Depth differences between the sites significantly explained 34.1% of the variation in coral community distribution. The back reef was characterized by corals within the genera Montipora, Astreopora and Acropora, whereas the fore reef was characterised by Pocillopora, Hydnophora, Leptoseris, Gardineroseris, Fungia, Favites and Favia. A core of 36 species/morphological groups was found to be best discriminator between the 11 sites. The ability to detect among-site community differences was only compromised at the species presence/absence resolution for transect sizes of 10-30 m2. Further monitoring and measuring of additional spatial and environmental variables at comparable levels would allow creation of an explanatory model for coral distribution at Palmyra and serve as a valuable management tool for predicting community changes in response to natural and proposed physical changes.","2008","2021-09-23 22:35:37","2021-09-23 22:35:37","2021-06-28 14:34:11","1-30","","","557","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In scleractinians, the majority of GAs manifested as hyperplasia of the basal body wall (52% of cases), with an associated absence or reduction of polyp structure (mesenteries and ﬁlaments, actinopharynx and tentacles), and depletion of zooxanthellae in the gastrodermis of the upper body wall. In the soft corals Sinularia sp. and Lobophytum sp., GAs exclusively manifested as prominent hyperplasia of the coenenchyme with an increased density of solenia. In contrast to scleractinians, soft coral GAs displayed an inﬂammatory and necrotizing component with marked edema of the mesoglea, accompanied by inﬁltrates of variably-sized granular amoebocytes. Fungi, algae, sponges, and Crustacea were present in some scleractinian GAs, but absent in soft coral GAs. Fragmentation of tissues was a common ﬁnding in Acropora acuminata and Montipora cf. dilatata colonies with tissue loss, although no obvious causative agents were seen. Discoloration in the zoanthid, Palythoa tuberculosa, was found to be the result of necrosis, while in Lobophytum sp. discoloration was the result of zooxanthellar depletion (bleaching).

Here, we use coralline fungal disease (CFD), a previously described CCA disease from the Pacific, to examine these simultaneous effects using both field observations and experimental manipulations.

Lowered pH may still reduce overall host survivorship, however, by reducing calcification and facilitating fungal bio-erosion.

With increasing depth, loss of light can lead to a reduced reliance on autotrophy and an increased reliance on heterotrophy by mixotrophic corals. However, the generality of such trophic zonation varies across contexts. By combining high-resolution oceanographic measurements with isotopic analyses (δ13C, δ15N) of multiple producer and consumer levels across depths (10–30 m) at a central Pacific oceanic atoll, we show trophic zonation in mixotrophic corals can be both present and absent within the same reef system. Deep-water internal waves that deliver cool particulate-rich waters to shallow reefs occurred across all sites (2.5–5.6 events w­ eek−1 at 30 m) but the majority of events remained depth-restricted (4.3–9.7% recorded at 30 m propagated to 10 m). In the absence of other particulate delivery, mixotrophs increased their relative degree of heterotrophy with increasing depth. However, where relatively long-lasting downwelling events (1.4–3.3 times the duration of any other site) occurred simultaneously, mixotrophs displayed elevated and consistent degrees of heterotrophy regardless of depth. Importantly, these long-lasting surface pulses were of a lagoonal origin, an area of rich heterotrophic resource supply. Under such circumstances, we hypothesize heterotrophic resource abundance loses its direct linkage with depth and, with resources readily available at all depths, trophic zonation is no longer present. Our results show that fine-scale intra-island hydrographic regimes and hydrodynamic connectivity between reef habitats contribute to explaining the context specific nature of coral trophic depth zonation in shallow reef ecosystems.","2018-04","2021-09-23 22:35:37","2021-09-23 22:35:37","2021-06-28 14:34:43","60","","4","165","","Mar Biol","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","Number: 4","","","","internal waves,; scleractinian corals,; conch reef,; florida-keys,; macroalga enteromorpha,; nutrient-uptake,; reef corals,; stable carbon,; tissue,; zooxanthellae","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Heuristic models have predicted both increases and decreases in parasite abundance in response to human disturbance, with empirical support for both. However, most studies focus on one or a few selected parasite species. Here, we assess the abundance of parasites of seven species of coral reef ﬁshes collected from three ﬁshed and three unﬁshed islands of the Line Islands archipelago in the central equatorial Paciﬁc. Because we chose ﬁsh hosts that spanned different trophic levels, taxonomic groups, and body sizes, we were able to compare parasite responses across a broad cross section of the total parasite community in the presence and absence of ﬁshing, a major human impact on marine ecosystems. We found that overall parasite species richness was substantially depressed on ﬁshed islands, but that the response of parasite abundance varied among parasite taxa: directly transmitted parasites were signiﬁcantly more abundant on ﬁshed than on unﬁshed islands, while the reverse was true for trophically transmitted parasites. This probably arises because trophically transmitted parasites require multiple host species, some of which are the top predators most sensitive to ﬁshing impacts. The increase in directly transmitted parasites appeared to be due to ﬁshing-driven compensatory increases in the abundance of their hosts. Together, these results provide support for the predictions of both heuristic models, and indicate that the direction of ﬁshing’s impact on parasite abundance is mediated by parasite traits, notably parasite transmission strategies.","2014-07","2021-09-23 22:35:37","2021-09-23 22:35:37","2021-06-28 14:34:49","1929-1946","","7","95","","Ecology","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","Number: 7","","","","Animals,; Fisheries,; Pacific Ocean,; Fishes,; Biodiversity,; Islands,; Fish Diseases/parasitology,; Parasitic Diseases, Animal/parasitology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Various reasons have been proposed to explain this phenomenon including increased human disturbance, pollution, or changes in coral reef biota that serve a major ecological function such as depletion of grazers. However, pinpointing the actual factors potentially responsible can be problematic. Here we show a phase shift from coral to the corallimorpharian Rhodactis howesii associated with a long line vessel that wrecked in 1991 on an isolated atoll (Palmyra) in the central Pacific Ocean. We documented high densities of R. howesii near the ship that progressively decreased with distance from the ship whereas R. howesii were rare to absent in other parts of the atoll. We also confirmed high densities of R. howesii around several buoys recently installed on the atoll in 2001. This is the first time that a phase shift on a coral reef has been unambiguously associated with man-made structures. This association was made, in part, because of the remoteness of Palmyra and its recent history of minimal human habitation or impact. Phase shifts can have long-term negative ramification for coral reefs, and eradication of organisms responsible for phase shifts in marine ecosystems can be difficult, particularly if such organisms cover a large area. The extensive R. howesii invasion and subsequent loss of coral reef habitat at Palmyra also highlights the importance of rapid removal of shipwrecks on corals reefs to mitigate the potential of reef overgrowth by invasives.","2008-08-20","2021-09-23 22:35:37","2021-09-23 22:35:37","2021-06-28 14:34:52","e2989","","8","3","","PLoS ONE","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","Number: 8","","","","Animals,; Ecosystem,; Hawaii,; Geography,; Conservation of Natural Resources,; Population Density,; Anthozoa/classification/growth & development,; Humans,; Marine Biology,; Accidents,; Parasites,; Ships","","McClain, Craig R.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, it is difficult to document species and sexual resource partitioning in marine ecosystems, given the intractability of these systems and the vagility of many marine animals. Here, we examined differences in the foraging behavior and prey selection of 2 congeneric and coexisting seabird species — masked boobies Sula dactylatra and red-footed boobies Sula sula — on Palmyra Atoll in the equatorial Pacific Ocean. These seabirds exhibit substantial size dimorphism between species and also have reverse sexual dimorphism within species. Pronounced interspecific differences in foraging patterns were observed with high-resolution GPS tracking devices, where smaller red-footed boobies conducted longer foraging trips (in both time and distance). Red-footed boobies also had more frequent landings on the sea surface, slower mean and maximum travel speeds, and more westerly trip azimuths. Stable isotope and diet analyses produced data that complemented returns from electronic tagging. Stable isotope ratios of carbon indicated that masked boobies foraged on prey with a less pelagic δ13C signature compared to red-footed boobies. In contrast, no gender differences were identified in any foraging parameters. The mechanisms for maintenance of these pronounced differences in niche partitioning across species were not explicitly examined, yet the data suggest physiological variation across species may be a more plausible mechanism than competitive interactions.","2010-03-22","2021-09-23 22:35:37","2021-09-23 22:35:37","2021-06-28 14:34:59","291-301","","","403","","Mar.

However, the breadth of rodents’ ecological impact, even after eradication, is not always fully recognized. For example, the most widespread invasive rodent, the black rat (Rattus rattus), while omnivorous, eats predominantly seeds and fruit. Yet, the effects of seed predation release after eradication on plant communities and ecological functions are not well understood, posing a gap for island restoration. We examined the role of seed predation release following black rat eradication in changes to tree composition and aboveground biomass across an islet network (Palmyra Atoll) in the Central Pacific. We conducted repeated surveys of seed, juvenile, and adult tree biomass and survival in permanent vegetation plots before and after the eradication of rats. We observed a 95% reduction in seed predation for an introduced, previously cultivated tree population (Cocos nucifera). Juvenile tree biomass of all species increased 14-fold, with C. nucifera increasing the most, suggesting that eradication increased this tree's competitive advantage. Indeed, based on stage-structured demographic models, rat eradication led to a 10% increase in C. nucifera population growth rate. The effect of invasive rodent seed predation varies considerably among the plant species in a community and can shift competitive dynamics, sometimes in favor of invasive plants. These bottom-up effects should be considered in evaluating the costs and benefits of eradication. Documenting the variation in invasive rodent diet items, along with long-term surveys, can help prioritize island eradications where restoration is most likely to be successful.","2021-01","2021-09-23 22:35:37","2021-09-23 22:35:37","2021-06-28 19:26:16","232-242","","1","53","","Biotropica","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","Number: 1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As prolific omnivores, invasive rats can cause local extirpation of a wide range of native species, with cascading consequences that can reshape communities and ecosystems. Eradication of rats on islands is now becoming a widespread approach to restore ecosystems, and many native island species show strong numerical responses to rat eradication. However, the effect of rat eradication on other consumers can extend beyond direct numerical effects, to changes in behavior, dietary composition, and other ecological parameters. These behavioral and trophic effects may have strong cascading impacts on the ecology of restored ecosystems, but they have rarely been examined. In this study, we explore how rat eradication has affected the trophic ecology of native land crab communities. Using stable isotope analysis of rats and crabs, we demonstrate that the diet or trophic position of most crabs changed subsequent to rat eradication. Combined with the numerical recovery of two carnivorous land crab species (Geograpsus spp.), this led to a dramatic widening of the crab trophic niche following rat eradication. Given the established importance of land crabs in structuring island communities, particularly plants, this suggests an unappreciated mechanism by which rat eradication may alter island ecology. This study also demonstrates the potential for stable isotope analysis as a complementary monitoring tool to traditional techniques, with the potential to provide more nuanced assessments of the community- and ecosystem-wide effects of restoration.","2017-11","2021-09-23 22:35:37","2021-09-23 22:35:37","2021-06-29 05:55:58","1015-1025","","6","25","","Restor Ecol","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","Number: 6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we report on the isotope signatures in green sea-turtle (Chelonia mydas) barnacles (Platylepas sp.) and discuss their potential relevance as tools with which to study green sea turtle migration and habitat use patterns. We analyzed oxygen (δ18O) and carbon (δ13C) isotope ratios in barnacle calcite layers from specimens collected from green turtles captured at the Palmyra Atoll National Wildlife Refuge (PANWR) in the central Paciﬁc. Carbon isotopes were not informative in this study. However, the oxygen isotope results suggest likely regional movement patterns when mapped onto a predictive oxygen isotope map of the Paciﬁc. Barnacle proxies could therefore complement other methods in understanding regional movement patterns, informing more effective conservation policy that takes into account connectivity between populations.","2015-12-08","2021-09-23 22:35:37","2021-09-23 22:35:37","2021-08-04 20:06:28","7081-7086","","23","12","","Biogeosciences","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","Number: 23","","","","central pacific,; ecology,; diversity,; phylogeography,; caretta-caretta,; commensal,; indicators,; marine turtles,; o-18,; parasites","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Competition can be especially acute for vegetation on Paciﬁc atolls, which depend upon consistent rainfall to replenish shallow groundwater stores. Patterns of sap ﬂow, water use, and diameter growth of Pisonia grandis trees were investigated on Sand Islet, Palmyra Atoll, Line Islands, during a period of low rainfall. Sap ﬂow in the outer sapwood was reduced by 53% for P. grandis trees growing within coconut palm (Cocos nucifera) stands (n = 9) versus away from coconut palm (n = 9). This suggested that water uptake was being limited by coconut palm. Radial patterns of sap ﬂow into the sapwood of P. grandis also differed between stands with and without coconut palm, such that individual tree water use for P. grandis ranged from 14 to 67 L dayÀ1, averaging 47·8 L dayÀ1 without coconut palm and 23·6 L dayÀ1 with coconut palm. Diameter growth of P. grandis was measured from nine islets. In contrast to sap ﬂow, competition with coconut palm increased diameter growth by 89%, equating to an individual tree basal area increment of 5·4 versus 10·3 mm2 dayÀ1. Greater diameter growth countered by lower rates of water use by P. grandis trees growing in competition with coconut palm suggests that stem swell may be associated with water storage when positioned in the understory of coconut palm, and may facilitate survival when water becomes limiting until too much shading overwhelms P. grandis.

Yet, the impacts of rat eradication on plant communities remain poorly understood. Here we compare native and non-native tree and palm seedling abundance before and after eradication of invasive rats (Rattus rattus) from Palmyra Atoll, Line Islands, Central Pacific Ocean. Overall, seedling recruitment increased for five of the six native trees species examined. While pre-eradication monitoring found no seedlings of Pisonia grandis, a dominant tree species that is important throughout the Pacific region, post-eradication monitoring documented a notable recruitment event immediately following eradication, with up to 688 individual P. grandis seedlings per 100m2 recorded one month post-eradication. Two other locally rare native trees with no observed recruitment in pre-eradication surveys had recruitment post-rat eradication. However, we also found, by five years post-eradication, a 13-fold increase in recruitment of the naturalized and range-expanding coconut palm Cocos nucifera. Our results emphasize the strong effects that a rat eradication can have on tree recruitment with expected long-term effects on canopy composition. Rat eradication released nonnative C. nucifera, likely with long-term implications for community composition, potentially necessitating future management interventions. Eradication, nevertheless, greatly benefit-ted recruitment of native tree species. If this pattern persists over time, we expect long-term benefits for flora and fauna dependent on these native species.","2018-07","2021-10-05 16:30:41","2021-10-05 16:30:41","","e0200743-e0200743","","7","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Public Library of Science","","","","Trees; Atolls; Forests; Invasive species; Islands; Predation; Seedlings; Seeds","","Bosso, Luciano","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Rats (Rattus spp.) have invaded most of the world’s oceanic islands, causing lasting or irreversible damage to ecosystems and biodiversity. To counter this threat, techniques to eradicate invasive rats from islands have been developed and applied across the globe. Eradication of alien rats from large or complex island ecosystems has only been successful with the use of bait containing a rodenticide. While eff ective at eradicating rats from islands, rodenticide can persist in the ecosystem longer than the time required to eradicate the target rat population and can potentially harm non-target species. However, the persistence of rodenticides in ecosystems following rat eradication campaigns is poorly understood, though predictions can be made based on the chemical properties of the rodenticide and the environment it is applied in. Brodifacoum, a relatively persistent second-generation anticoagulant, was used to successfully eradicate rats from Palmyra Atoll. With this study, we evaluated the persistence of brodifacoum residues in terrestrial and marine species at Palmyra Atoll (Northern Line Islands) three years after rat eradication. We collected 44 pooled samples containing 121 individuals of the following: mullet (Moolgarda engeli), cockroaches (Periplaneta sp.), geckos (Lepidodactylus lugubris), hermit crabs (Coenobita perlatus), and fi ddler crabs (Uca tetragonon). Despite detection of brodifacoum residue in all fi ve of the species sampled in this study 60 days after the application of bait to Palmyra Atoll in 2011, brodifacoum residue was not found in any of the pooled samples collected three years after bait application. Our study demonstrates how brodifacoum residues are unlikely to persist in the marine and terrestrial food web, in a wet tropical environment, three years after rat eradication.","2019","2021-10-05 16:30:42","2021-10-05 16:35:59","","596-599","","2015","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","/Users/camilavargas/Desktop/PADL/Palmyra Papers/Alex References/Wegmann et al 2019.pdf","","land crabs; aerial rodenticide broadcast; best practice; brodifacoum anticoagulant rodenticide; rattus rattus; risk assessment; tropical island","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The non-target consequences and the fate of toxicant residue from such rodent eradication operations have not been well explored. In a cooperative effort, we monitored the application of a rodenticide, 'Brodifacoum 25W: Conservation', during an attempt to eradicate Rattus rattus from Palmyra Atoll. In 2011, Brodifacoum 25W: Conservation was aerially broadcasted twice over the entire atoll (2.5km2) at rates of 80kg/ha and 75kg/ha and a supplemental hand broadcast application (71.6kg/ha) occurred three weeks after the second aerial application over a 10ha area. We documented brodifacoum residues in soil, water, and biota, and documented mortality of non-target organisms. Some bait (14-19% of the target application rate) entered the marine environment to distances 7m from the shore. After the application commenced, carcasses of 84 animals representing 15 species of birds, fish, reptiles and invertebrates were collected opportunistically as potential non-target mortalities. In addition, fish, reptiles, and invertebrates were systematically collected for residue analysis. Brodifacoum residues were detected in most (84.3%) of the animal samples analyzed. Although detection of residues in samples was anticipated, the extent and concentrations in many parts of the food web were greater than expected. Risk assessments should carefully consider application rates and entire food webs prior to operations using rodenticides.","2015","2021-10-05 16:30:42","2021-10-05 16:30:42","","36-46","","","185","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","","","","Aerial broadcast; Brodifacoum rodenticide; Invasive rodent eradication; Toxicant residue; Trophic level bioaccumulation; Tropical island forest","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
