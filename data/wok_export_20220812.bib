Abstract = {Palmyra Atoll, once a WWII U.S. Navy air station, is now a U.S. National
   Wildlife Refuge with nearly 50 km(2) of coral reef and 275 ha of
   emergent lands with forests of Pisonia grandis trees and colonies of
   several bird species. Due to the known elemental and organic
   contamination from chemicals associated with aviation, power generation
   and transmission, waste management, and other air station activities, a
   screening survey to map elemental concentrations was conducted. A map of
   1944 Navy facilities was georeferenced and identifiable features were
   digitized. These data informed a targeted survey of 25 elements in soils
   and sediment at locations known or suspected to be contaminated, using a
   hand-held X-ray fluorescence spectrometer. At dozens of locations,
   concentrations of elements exceeded established soil and marine sediment
   thresholds for adverse ecological effects. Results were compiled into a
   publically available geospatial dataset to inform potential remediation
   and habitat restoration activities.},

Abstract = {Palmyra Atoll, in the Central Pacific, is a unique marine ecosystem
   because of its remarkably intact food web and limited anthropogenic
   stressors. However during World War II the atoll was structurally
   reconfigured into a military installation and questions remain whether
   this may have impacted the health of the atoll's ecosystems and species.
   To address the issue we assessed green sea turtle (n = 157) health and
   exposure to contaminants at this foraging ground from 2008 to 2012.
   Physical exams were performed and blood was sampled for testosterone
   analysis, plasma biochemistry analysis, hematology and heavy metal
   exposure. Hematological and plasma chemistries were consistent with
   concentrations reported for healthy green turtles. Heavy metal
   screenings revealed low concentrations of most metals, except for high
   concentrations of iron and aluminum. Body condition indices showed that
   <1\% of turtles had poor body condition. In this study, we provide the
   first published blood values for a markedly healthy sea turtle
   population at a remote Central Pacific Atoll. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Title = {Proximate environmental drivers of coral communities at Palmyra Atoll:
   Establishing baselines prior to removing a WWII military causeway},
Journal = {MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {62},
Number = {8},
Pages = {1842-1851},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {A management proposal aims to partly remove a WWII military causeway at
   Palmyra Atoll to improve lagoon water circulation and alleviate
   sedimentation stress on the southeast backreef, an area of high coral
   cover and diversity. This action could result in a shift in
   sedimentation across reef sites. To provide management advice, we
   quantified the proximate environmental factors driving scleractinian
   coral cover and community patterns at Palmyra. The proportion of fine
   sedimentation was the optimal predictor of coral cover and changes in
   community structure, explaining 23.7\% and 24.7\% of the variation
   between sites, respectively. Scleractinian coral cover was negatively
   correlated with increases in fine sedimentation. Removing the causeway
   could negatively affect the Montipora corals that dominate the western
   reef terrace, as this genus was negatively correlated with levels of
   fine sedimentation. The tolerance limits of corals, and sediment
   re-distribution patterns, should be determined prior to complete removal
   of the causeway. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Spatial and temporal patterns of scleractinian coral, soft coral, and

Abstract = {There is an urgent need for accurate baselines of coral disease
   prevalence across our oceans in order for sudden or unnatural changes to
   be recognized. Palmyra Atoll allows us to study disease dynamics under
   near-pristine, functionally intact conditions. We examined disease
   prevalence among all known species of scleractinian coral, soft coral
   and zoanthid (Palythoa) at a variety of coral reef habitats at Palmyra
   over a 2 yr period. In 2008, overall disease prevalence across the atoll
   was low (0.33\%), but higher on the shallower backreef (0.88\%) and reef
   terrace (0.80\%) than on the deeper forereef (0.09\%). Scleractinian
   coral disease prevalence was higher (0.30\%) than were soft coral and
   zoanthid disease (0.03\% combined). Growth anomalies (GAs) were the most
   commonly encountered lesions, with scleractinian species in the genera
   Astreopora (2.12\%), Acropora (1.30\%), and Montipora (0.98\%) showing
   the highest prevalence atoll-wide. Discoloration necrosis (DN) was most
   prevalent in the zoanthid Palythoa tuberculosa (1.18\%), although the
   soft coral Sinularia and Montipora also had a prevalence of 0.44 and
   0.01\%, respectively. Overall disease prevalence within permanently
   marked transects increased from 0.65\% in 2008 to 0.79\% in 2009.
   Palythoa DN contributed most to this increased prevalence, which
   coincided with rising temperatures during the 2009 El Nino. GAs on the
   majority of susceptible genera at Palmyra increased in number over time,
   and led to tissue death. Host distribution and environmental factors (e.
   g. temperature) appear to be important for determining spatiotemporal
   patterns of disease at Palmyra. More sophisticated analyses are required
   to tease apart the likely inter-correlated proximate drivers of disease
   occurrence on remote, near-pristine reefs.},

Title = {A phylogenomic examination of Palmyra Atoll's corallimorpharian invader},
Journal = {CORAL REEFS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {41},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {673-685},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The reefs at Palmyra Atoll, a small outlying atoll in the equatorial
   Pacific, have been undergoing a phase shift from scleractinian corals to
   a corallimorph-dominated benthos. It has been unclear whether there has
   been cryptic speciation or morphological plasticity leading to different
   ecotypes of Rhodactis howesii. Here, we use mitochondrial genomic
   analysis to assess species validation and underlying cause of
   morphological variation across the atoll. We mapped sequenced reads to
   Rhodactis indosinensis, R. howesii's closest recorded genomic taxon. In
   addition to one individual from American Samoa, we assessed phylogenetic
   relationships of published corallimorph genomes with those from Palmyra.
   There was no identifiable population structure within Palmyra, and
   available dinoflagellate symbiont communities were consistent among the
   sequenced individuals. There were noticeable differences in symbiont
   communities between Palmyra and American Samoa individuals, as well as
   six fixed nucleotide differences. We conclude that the lack of
   taxonomically validated genetic reference material together with vague
   species descriptions, morphological plasticity and overlap among
   morphological characters, combine to raise doubts about the validity of
   the currently accepted species name, R. howesii. Comparison of our
   results to all currently available genetic data for corallimorpharians
   suggests that the species at Palmyra is most closely related to an
   unidentified species of Rhodactis from Okinawa. However, taxonomically
   confirmed R. howesii is absent from genetic databases, so no firm
   conclusions about species identification can yet be drawn. It seems
   clear that this group is in need of additional taxonomic work and a
   broad phylogenetic survey of taxa with geographic distribution would
   further our understanding of marine biodiversity, conservation, and
   invasion dynamics of this understudied group.},

Abstract = {Animal movements, residence times, and subsequently foraging strategies,
   should vary with habitat quality. We used acoustic and satellite
   telemetry, as well as stable isotopes, to look at movement patterns,
   macro-scale habitat use, and trophic ecology of blacktip reef sharks,
   Carcharhinus melanopterus, between two lagoons (eastern and western) at
   Palmyra Atoll, a US National Wildlife Refuge in the central Pacific.
   Sharks in the Palmyra lagoons have relatively small home ranges and
   appear to obtain most of their energy from the lagoon ecosystem. Sharks
   showed low levels of migration between lagoons over periods of several
   years, and individuals in the larger western lagoon tended to have
   longer residence times than those in the smaller eastern lagoon.
   Furthermore, for sharks in the western lagoon, there was no relationship
   between total length (TL) and delta N-15, C-13 relative isotope
   concentrations, or a Body Condition index (BC). For sharks in the
   eastern lagoon, TL was positively related to delta N-15 and negatively
   related to delta C-13 and BC. These results suggest that there are low
   levels of mixing of sharks between lagoons, and these are leading to
   differences in trophic ecology and potentially foraging success.
   Although the causative factors behind these differences are unknown,
   shark home range location can potentially lead to variation in trophic
   ecology, even over small spatial scales. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All

   confusus on Carangoides ferdau, Carangoides orthogrammus, Caranx
   ignobilis, Caranx melampygus, and Caranx papuensis; Caligus kapuhili on
   Chaetodon auriga and Chaetodon lunula; Caligus laticaudus on
   Rhinecanthus aculeatus, Pseudobalistes flavimarginatus, M.
   flavolineatus, Upeneus taeniopterus, Chrysiptera glauca, and Epinephalus
   merra; Caligus mutabilis on Lutjanus fulvus and Lutjanus monostigma;

Journal = {ZOOKEYS},
Year = {2017},
Number = {713},
Pages = {1-23},
Month = {NOV 2},
Abstract = {A survey of the monogeneans of fishes from the lagoon flats of Palmyra
   Atoll detected 16 species already reported from the Indo-West Pacific
   faunal region. A total of 653 individual fish from 44 species were
   collected from the sand flats bordering the lagoon of the atoll.
   Eighteen species of fish were infected with monogeneans. The monogenean
   species recovered were: Benedenia hawaiiensis on Acanthurus
   xanthopterus, Chaetodon auriga, Chaetodon lunula, Mulloidichthys
   flavolineatus, Pseudobalistes flavimarginatus and Rhinecanthus
   aculeatus; Ancyrocephalus ornatus on Arothron hispidus; Euryhaliotrema
   annulocirrus on Chaetodon auriga and Chaetodon lunula; Euryhaliotrema
   chrysotaeniae on Lutjanus fulvus; Euryhaliotrema grandis on Chaetodon
   auriga and Chaetodon lunula; Haliotrema acanthuri on Acanthurus
   triostegus; Haliotrema aurigae on Chaetodon auriga and Chaetodon lunula;
   Haliotrema dempsteri on Acanthurus xanthopterus; Haliotrema
   minutospirale on Mulloidichthys flavolineatus; Haliotrematoides
   patellacirrus on Lutjanus monostigma; Neohaliotrema bombini on Abudefduf
   septemfasciatus and Abudefduf sordidus; Acleotrema girellae and
   Acleotrema parastromatei on Kyphosus cinerascens; Cemocotylella elongata
   on Caranx ignobilis, Caranx melampygus and Caranx papuensis;
   Metamicrocotyla macracantha on Crenimugil crenilabris; and
   Pseudopterinotrema albulae on Albula glossodonta. All these
   monogenean-host combinations represent new geographical records. The
   monogenean species composition of the Palmyra Atoll is similar to that
   of the Hawaiian Islands. However, the number of species recovered was
   lower compared with other localities within the Indo-West Pacific,
   perhaps due to the geographical isolation of Palmyra Atoll.},

Title = {Characterizing coral reef biodiversity: genetic species delimitation in

Journal = {MITOCHONDRIAL DNA PART A},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {31},
Number = {5},

Month = {JUL 3},
Abstract = {Coral reefs are highly threatened ecosystems, yet there are numerous
   challenges in conducting inventories of their vanishing biodiversity,
   partly because many taxa remain difficult to detect and describe.
   Genetic species delimitation methods provide a standardized means for
   taxonomic classification including of cryptic, rare, or elusive groups,
   but results can vary by analytical method and genetic marker. In this
   study, a combination of morphological and genetic identification methods
   was used to estimate species richness and identify taxonomic units in
   true crabs (Infraorder Brachyura; n = 200) from coral reefs of Palmyra
   Atoll, Central Pacific. Genetic identification was based on matches
   between mitochondrial 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) and/or
   cytochromecoxidase subunit I (COI) sequences to GenBank data, while
   morphological work relied on the taxonomic literature. Broad agreement
   in the number of candidate species delimited by genetic distance
   thresholds and tree-based approaches was found, although the multi-rate
   Poisson tree process (mPTP) was less appropriate for this dataset. The
   COI sequence data identified 30-32 provisional species and the 16S data
   revealed 34-35. The occurrence of 10 families, 20 genera, and 19 species
   of brachyurans at Palmyra was corroborated by at least two methods.
   Diversity levels withinChlorodiella laevissimaindicated possible
   undescribed or cryptic species in currently lumped taxa. These results
   illustrate the efficacy of DNA sequences in identifying organisms and
   detecting cryptic variation, and underscore the importance of using
   appropriate genetic markers and multiple species delimitation analyses,
   with applications for future species descriptions.},

Abstract = {Localised loss of live coral cover at Palmyra Atoll (central Pacific
   Ocean) has been attributed to increased temperature and/or sedimentation
   arising from alterations made to the lagoon system. It has been
   hypothesised that a causeway spanning the lagoon hinders water
   circulation, resulting in warmer and/or more turbid water flowing
   towards a site of high coral cover and diversity (Coral Gardens).
   Analyses of a multi-site and multi-year data set revealed no differences
   in mean temperature or turbidity values on either side of the causeway
   and provided no evidence of significantly warmer or more turbid water at
   Coral Gardens. We conclude that the putative decline in live coral cover
   cannot be attributed to the presence of the causeway and that proposed
   management actions involving modification to the causeway cannot achieve
   the conservation outcomes suggested of them. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {Anthropogenic lead (Pb) inputs to the atmosphere increased greatly over
   the past century and now dominate Pb supply to the oceans. However, the
   Pb content of sediments across the equatorial Pacific region is
   relatively unknown, and data exist only for deep sea sites where Pb
   deposition lags surface water inputs by up to a century. Here we present
   ICP-MS analyses of Pb of a core from a lagoon at Palmyra Atoll, northern
   Line Islands, that spans approximately the past 160 years. The
   non-bioturbated sediments of the euxinic lagoon, coupled with rapid
   rates of deposition, provide a unique fine-scale record of atmospheric
   Pb supply at a remote Pacific location. These first observations of
   historic Pb sedimentation in an atoll lagoon reveal a 63-fold increase
   in Pb flux to sediments during the past century and correlate directly
   with the North American consumption of leaded gasoline that began in
   1926. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Distribution, abundance, and microhabitat characterization of small
   juvenile corals at Palmyra Atoll},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {376},
Pages = {133-142},
Abstract = {Juvenile corals are an important component of the population dynamics of
   corals, but little is known about the ecology and natural history of
   their early life-history stages. In demographic surveys, small juvenile
   corals are often grouped with larger and older corals or overlooked
   entirely due to their small size and cryptic nature. This study
   describes the distribution, abundance, and microhabitat of small
   juvenile corals, defined as post-settlement corals <= 5 mm in diameter,
   at Palmyra Atoll, Central Pacific. A diver-operated pulsating blue tight
   and filter system was used to enhance innate coral fluorescence during
   daylight to aid in detecting small juvenile corals. Juvenile densities
   ranged from 0 to 59.5 m(-2) and were more than 9 times higher on the
   fore reef (21.9 +/- 0.8 m(-2)) than on the back reef (2.4 +/- 0.3
   m(-2)). The highest juvenile densities were observed in the middle of
   the sampled range at 14 m depth on the fore reef. Juvenile corals
   accounted for >31 \% of coral colonies in all habitats and depths, which
   resulted in positively skewed size-frequency distributions. The
   microhabitat of juvenile corals on coral rubble was best described as a
   convex surface covered with crustose coralline algae that lacked another
   coral within a 20 mm radius. This study provides basic ecology and
   natural history information of small juvenile corals and shows the
   feasibility of surveying corals <= 5 mm in diameter as a method for
   monitoring coral populations and assessing environmental changes on a
   coral reef.},

Title = {El Nino effects in the Palmyra Atoll region: oceanographic changes and

Journal = {FISHERIES OCEANOGRAPHY},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {15},

Pages = {477-489},
Abstract = {A generalized additive model (GAM) was constructed to separate and
   quantify the effects of fishery-based (operational) and oceanographic
   parameters on the bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus) catch rates at Palmyra
   Atoll in the central Tropical Pacific. Bigeye catch, the number of hooks
   per set, and set location from 4884 longline sets spanning January 1994
   to December 2003 were used with a temporally corresponding El
   Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) indicator built from sea surface height
   (SSH) data. Observations of environmental data combined with the results
   from the GAM indicated that there is an increase in bigeye catch rates
   corresponding to an increase in eastward advection during the winter
   months of El Nino events. A seasonal pattern with higher bigeye catch
   rates from December to April and a spatial pattern with higher rates to
   the northeast and northwest of the atoll were observed during this study
   period. It is hypothesized that the combination of the eastward
   advection of the warm pool coupled with vertical changes in temperature
   during the winter months of El Nino events increases the availability of
   bigeye tuna in this region. This increase in availability may be due to
   a change in exploitable population size, location, or both.},

Abstract = {Here, we present the results of a taxonomic survey of the nematodes
   parasitizing fishes from the lagoon flats of Palmyra Atoll, Eastern
   Indo-Pacific. We performed quantitative parasitological surveys of 653
   individual fish from each of the 44 species using the intertidal sand
   flats that border the atoll's lagoon. We provide morphological
   descriptions, prevalence, and mean intensities of the recovered seven
   species of adult nematode (Pulchrascaris chiloscyllii, Capillariidae
   gen. sp., Cucullanus bourdini, Cucullanus oceaniensis, Pseudascarophis
   sp., Spinitectus (Paraspinitectus) palmyraensis sp. nov., Philometra
   pellucida) and three larval stages (Pulchrascaris sp., Hysterothylacium
   sp., Cucullanus sp.). We recorded: Pulchrascaris chiloscyllii from
   Carcharhinus melanopterus; Capillariidae gen. sp. from Chaetodon lunula,
   Lutjanus fulvus, and Ellochelon vaigiensis; Cucullanus bourdini from
   Arothron hispidus; Cucullanus oceaniensis from Abudefduf sordidus;
   Pseudascarophis sp. from Chaetodon auriga, Chaetodon lunula, and
   Mulloidichthys flavolineatus; Spinitectus (Paraspinitectus) palmyraensis
   sp. nov. from Albula glossodonta; Philometra pellucida from Arothron
   hispidus; and three larval forms, Pulchrascaris sp. from Acanthurus
   triostegus, Acanthurus xanthopterus, Rhinecanthus aculeatus, Platybelone

   Ellochelon vaigiensis, Mulloidichthys flavolineatus, Upeneus
   taeniopterus, Gymnothorax pictus, Abudefduf septemfasciatus, Abudefduf
   sordidus, and Stegastes nigricans; Hysterothylacium sp. type MD from
   Acanthurus triostegus, Carangoides ferdau, Chaetodon lunula, Chanos
   chanos, Kyphosus cinerascens, Abudefduf sordidus, and Arothron hispidus;
   and Cucullanus sp. from Caranx ignobilis. Spinitectus (Paraspinitectus)
   palmyraensis sp. nov. (Cystidicolidae) is described from the intestine
   of roundjaw bonefish Albula glossodonta. All the nematode species
   reported in this study represent new geographical records. We discuss
   how our survey findings compare to other areas of the Indo-Pacific, and
   the way the relatively numerical dominance of trophically transmitted
   larval stages likely reflect the intact food web of Palmyra Atoll, which
   includes a large biomass of large-bodied top predator sharks and
   ray-finned fishes.},

Abstract = {Palmyra Atoll, USA, in the Central Pacific, has remained mostly
   uninhabited since construction and abandonment of a U.S. naval base
   during World War II. However, the effects of Navy modifications have
   persisted, affecting physical conditions and benthic habitat quality of
   Palmyra's lagoon sand flats. Sand flats provide important nonbreeding
   habitat for Bristle-thighed Curlews (Numenius tahitiensis), a migratory
   shorebird listed as ``vulnerable{''} by the International Union for
   Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources. We used camera trapping,
   observations of focal individuals, and quantification of prey
   availability and sediment characteristics to assess curlew habitat use
   across different levels of historical anthropogenic impact. Habitat
   preferences were not determined by the degree of land reclamation impact
   on lagoon flat habitat, although the two most preferred sites were both
   highly impacted. Curlew abundance was most strongly correlated with
   availability of prey items, such as spionid polychaetes (Malacoceros
   sp.). Our findings provide new ecological information on a shorebird
   species that is rarely studied and provides useful information for
   habitat management at Palmyra Atoll and other curlew wintering grounds.},

Title = {Cryptic species obscure introduction pathway of the blue Caribbean
   sponge (Haliclona (Soestella) caerulea), (order: Haplosclerida) to
   Palmyra Atoll, Central Pacific},
Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {3},
Month = {AUG 6},
Abstract = {Cryptic species are widespread across the phylum Porifera making the
   identification of non-indigenous species difficult, an issue not easily
   resolved by the use of morphological characteristics. The widespread
   order Haplosclerida is a prime example due to limited and plastic
   morphological features. Here, we study the reported introduction of
   Haliclona (Soestella) caerulea from the Caribbean to Palmyra Atoll via
   Hawai'i using morphological characteristics and genetic analyses based
   on one nuclear (18s rDNA) and three mitochondrial (COI, the barcoding
   COI extension (COI ext.) and rnl rDNA) markers. Despite no clear
   division in lengths of the oxea spicules between the samples, both mtDNA
   and nDNA phylogenetic trees supported similar topologies resolving two
   distinct clades. Across the two clades, the concatenated mtDNA tree
   resolved twelve subclades, with the COI ext. yielding most of the
   variability between the samples. Low sequence divergence values (0.68\%)
   between two of the subclades indicate that the same species is likely to
   occur at Palmyra, Hawai'i and the Caribbean, supporting the hypothesis
   that H. caerulea was introduced to Palmyra from the Caribbean, although
   whether species came directly from the Caribbean to Palmyra or from
   Hawai'i remains unresolved. Conversely, the pattern of highly divergent
   cryptic species supports the notion that traditionally used spicule
   measurements are taxonomically unreliable in this group. This study
   illustrates how understanding the scale of within-as opposed to
   between-species level genetic variation is critical for interpreting
   biogeographic patterns and inferring the origins of introduced
   organisms.},

Abstract = {At Palmyra Atoll, the environmental DNA (eDNA) signal on tidal sand
   flats was associated with fish biomass density and captured 98\%-100\%
   of the expected species diversity there. Although eDNA spilled over
   across habitats, species associated with reef habitat contributed more
   eDNA to reef sites than to sand-flat sites, and species associated with
   sand-flat habitat contributed more eDNA to sand-flat sites than to reef
   sites. Tides did not disrupt the sand-flat habitat signal. At least 25
   samples give a coverage >97.5\% at this diverse, tropical, marine
   system.},

Abstract = {The lagoon at Palmyra Atoll in the central Pacific was subject to major
   military modifications during WWII and now the dominant fauna on the
   lagoon's hard substrate are sponges, not corals. In this study, we
   quantified the physical and biological factors explaining the variation
   in sponge distribution patterns across 11 sites to determine the
   potential for the sponges in the lagoon at Palmyra to invade the
   surrounding reef systems. Significant differences in sponge assemblages
   were found among all but three sites. For all the models we examined the
   strongest environmental relationships were found for variables related
   to sedimentation/turbidity and food/habitat availability. Our findings
   suggest that the sponges in Palmyra's lagoon are likely to be restricted
   to this habitat type where they are associated with conditions resulting
   from the earlier heavy disturbance and are unlikely to spread to the
   outer reef environments unless there is a dramatic decline in
   environmental quality. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Modeling patterns of coral bleaching at a remote Central Pacific atoll},
Journal = {MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {60},
Number = {9},
Pages = {1467-1476},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {A mild bleaching event (9.2\% prevalence) at Palmyra Atoll occurred in
   response to the 2009 ENSO, when mean water temperature reached 29.8-30.1
   degrees C. Prevalence among both abundant and sparse taxa varied with no
   clear pattern in susceptibility relating to coral morphology. Seven
   taxon-specific models showed that turbidity exacerbated while prior
   exposure to higher background temperatures alleviated bleaching, with
   these predictors explaining an average 16.3\% and 11.5\% variation in
   prevalence patterns, respectively. Positive associations occurred
   between bleaching prevalence and both immediate temperature during the
   bleaching event (average 8.4\% variation explained) and increased sand
   cover (average 3.7\%). Despite these associations, mean unexplained
   variation in prevalence equalled 59\%. Lower bleaching prevalence in
   areas experiencing higher background temperatures suggests acclimation
   to temperature stress among several coral genera, while WWII
   modifications may still be impacting the reefs via shoreline sediment
   re-distribution and increased turbidity, exacerbating coral bleaching
   susceptibility during periods of high temperature stress. (C) 2010

Title = {Decadal stability of coral reef benthic communities on Palmyra Atoll,

Journal = {CORAL REEFS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {41},

Abstract = {The prevalence of coral bleaching due to thermal stress has been
   increasing on coral reefs worldwide. While many studies have documented
   how corals respond to warming, fewer have focused on benthic community
   responses over longer time periods or on the response of non-coral taxa
   (e.g., crustose coralline algae, macroalgae, or turf). Here, we quantify
   spatial and temporal changes in benthic community composition over a
   decade using image analysis of permanent photoquadrats on Palmyra Atoll
   in the central Pacific Ocean. Eighty permanent plots were photographed
   annually between 2009 and 2018 on both the wave-exposed fore reef (FR,
   10 m depth, n = 4 sites) and the wave-sheltered reef terrace (RT, 5 m
   depth, n = 4 sites) habitats. The El Nino events of 2009-2010 and
   2015-2016 resulted in acute thermal stress and coral bleaching was
   observed at both reef habitats during these events. Across 10 yr and two
   bleaching events, the benthic community structure on Palmyra shows
   evidence of long-term stability. Communities on the RT exhibited minimal
   change in percent cover of the dominant functional groups, while the FR
   had greater variability and minor declines in hard coral cover. There
   was also spatial variation in the trajectory of each site through time.
   Coral cover decreased at some sites 1 yr following both bleaching events
   and was replaced by different algal groups depending on the site, yet
   returned to pre-bleaching levels within 2 yr. Overall, our data reveal
   the resilience of calcifier-dominated coral reef communities on Palmyra
   Atoll that have persisted over the last decade despite two bleaching
   events, demonstrating the capacity for these reefs to recover from
   and/or withstand disturbances in the absence of local stressors.},

Abstract = {During 2015-2016, an El Nino and associated warm water event caused
   widespread coral bleaching across the equatorial Pacific. Here, we
   combine 8 yr of benthic monitoring data from permanent photoquadrats
   with remotely sensed and in situ temperature measurements to assess the
   impact of the warming event on benthic communities at Palmyra Atoll. We
   quantified bleaching prevalence across two distinct reef habitats using
   the best available data. On the fore reef (similar to 10 m depth), we
   quantified bleaching severity within 100-200 m(2) large-area plots using
   the custom visualization and analysis software, Viscore. On the reef
   terrace (similar to 5 m depth), we used 95 focal colonies across three
   species that have been monitored annually since 2014. The 2015-2016 warm
   water event was the most extreme such event recorded on Palmyra in the
   past several decades with a maximum cumulative heat stress (degree
   heating weeks) of 11.9 degrees C-weeks. On the fore reef, 90\% of live
   coral cover exhibited some degree of bleaching (32\% severe bleaching).
   On the shallow reef terrace, bleaching was observed in 93\% of the focal
   colonies across all species. Overall, coral cover declined 9\% on the
   fore reef from 2014 to 2017, whereas coral cover did not change on the
   terrace. These contrasting results may be associated with typical daily
   temperature ranges on the terrace that are three times greater than on
   the fore reef. Permanent photoquadrats showed that turf algae initially
   colonized skeletons of recently dead corals but transitioned to crustose
   coralline algae within a year. Collectively, our study emphasizes that
   comprehensive monitoring of benthic communities over time combined with
   in situ temperature data can provide taxonomically precise trajectories
   of community change during and following thermal stress.},

Abstract = {In 2007, a phase shift from corals to corallimorpharians (CM) centered
   around a shipwreck was documented at Palmyra Atoll, Line Islands.
   Subsequent surveys revealed CM to be overgrowing the reef benthos,
   including corals and coralline algae, potentially placing coral
   ecosystems in the atoll at risk. This prompted the U.S. Fish and
   Wildlife Service, the lead management agency of the atoll, to remove the
   shipwreck. Subsequent surveys showed reductions in CM around the ship
   impact site. We explain patterns of spread of the CM in terms of both
   life history and local currents and show with a pilot study that
   pulverized bleach may be an effective tool to eradicate CM on a local
   scale. If applied strategically, particularly in heavily infested (>
   66\% cover) areas, active intervention such as this could be an
   effective management tool to reduce CM impact on localized areas and
   decrease colonization rate of remaining reefs. This is the first
   documentation of the response of an invasive cnidarian to shipwreck
   removal. While this was a singular event in Palmyra, the spatial and
   temporal patterns of this invasion and the eradications lessons
   described herein, are useful for anticipating and controlling similar
   situations elsewhere.},

Title = {Marine protected areas and migratory species: residency of green turtles
   at Palmyra Atoll, Central Pacific},
Journal = {ENDANGERED SPECIES RESEARCH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {37},
Pages = {165-182},
Abstract = {Protected areas are a cornerstone of conservation strategies globally,
   yet questions remain about their impacts, including on highly migratory
   species. The Palmyra Atoll National Wildlife Refuge, one of the Northern
   Line Islands in the Central Pacific, contains a regionally significant
   green turtle Chelonia mydas foraging ground. Residency patterns of this
   species were investigated through satellite telemetry (n = 15 males, 1
   female, 2 subadults) and flipper tagging (n = 555) between 2008 and
   2013. Almost every captured turtle was flipper-tagged, but telemetry
   efforts focused primarily on adult males, which have been studied
   infrequently. Overall, the turtles tracked during 4076 transmission days
   (mean = 227, range = 37 to 633) had high site fidelity and small home
   ranges, and remained close to their capture sites in waters <= 50 m
   deep. Five turtles were tracked for >1 yr, but none left Palmyra on
   annual breeding migrations. Only one satellite-tracked turtle departed
   the atoll, covering a total distance of similar to 5600 km in a
   near-circular loop. Similarly, flipper tag recaptures on the atoll (n =
   67) occurred near the original capture site. However, additional tags
   were recovered from 1 female in Kiritimati, Northern Line Islands, and
   from 1 subadult in Kosrae, Micronesia, similar to 690 and 3800 km away
   from Palmyra, respectively. Such extended, spatially restricted
   residency with low turnover is expected in small, high-quality habitats.
   The study highlights the importance of this protected area, which
   harbors regionally endangered turtles whose movements over several years
   are almost entirely encompassed within its established boundaries.},

Abstract = {Accurate predictions of how coral reefs may respond to global climate
   change hinge on understanding the natural variability to which these
   ecosystems are exposed and to which they contribute. We present
   high-resolution estimates of net community calcification (NCC) and net
   community production (NCP) from Palmyra Atoll, an uninhabited,
   near-pristine coral reef ecosystem in the central Pacific. In
   August-October 2012, we employed a combination of Lagrangian and
   Eulerian frameworks to establish high spatial (similar to 2.5 km(2)) and
   temporal (hourly) resolution coral community metabolic estimates.
   Lagrangian drifts, all conducted during daylight hours, resulted in NCC
   estimates of -51 to 116 mmol C m(-2) h(-1), although most NCC estimates
   were in the range of 0-40 mmol C m(-2) h(-1). Lagrangian drift NCP
   estimates ranged from -7 to 67 mmol C m(-2) h(-1). In the Eulerian
   setup, we present carbonate system parameters (dissolved inorganic
   carbon, total alkalinity, pH, and pCO(2)) at sub-hourly resolution
   through several day-night cycles and provide hourly NCC and NCP rate
   estimates. We compared diel cycles of all four carbonate system
   parameters to the offshore surface water (0-50 m depth) and show large
   departures from offshore surface water chemistry. Hourly Eulerian
   estimates of NCC aggregated over the entire study ranged from 14 to 53
   mmol C m(-2) h(-1), showed substantial variability during daylight
   hours, and exhibited a diel cycle with elevated NCC in the afternoons
   and depressed, but positive, NCC at night. The Eulerian NCP range was
   very high (-55 to 177 mmol C m(-2) h(-1)) and exhibited strong
   variability during daylight hours. Principal components analysis
   revealed that NCC and NCP were most closely aligned with diel cycle
   forcing, whereas the NCC/NCP ratio was most closely aligned with reef
   community composition. Our analysis demonstrates that ecological
   community composition is the primary determinant of coral reef
   biogeochemistry on a near-pristine reef and that reef biogeochemistry is
   likely to be responsive to human behaviors that alter community
   composition.},

Abstract = {Population connectivity and spatial distribution are fundamentally
   related to ecology, evolution and behaviour. Here, we combined powerful
   genetic analysis with simulations of particle dispersal in a
   high-resolution ocean circulation model to investigate the distribution
   of green turtles foraging at the remote Palmyra Atoll National Wildlife
   Refuge, central Pacific. We analysed mitochondrial sequences from
   turtles (n = 349) collected there over 5 years (2008-2012). Genetic
   analysis assigned natal origins almost exclusively (approx. 97\%) to the
   West Central and South Central Pacific combined Regional Management
   Units. Further, our modelling results indicated that turtles could
   potentially drift from rookeries to Palmyra Atoll via surface currents
   along a near-Equatorial swathe traversing the Pacific. Comparing
   findings from genetics and modelling highlighted the complex impacts of
   ocean currents and behaviour on natal origins. Although the Palmyra
   feeding ground was highly differentiated genetically from others in the
   Indo-Pacific, there was no significant differentiation among years,
   sexes or stage-classes at the Refuge. Understanding the distribution of
   this foraging population advances knowledge of green turtles and
   contributes to effective conservation planning for this threatened
   species.},

Title = {Quantifying patterns of fish herbivory on Palmyra Atoll (USA), an
   uninhabited predator-dominated central Pacific coral reef},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {501},
Pages = {141-155},
Abstract = {On many coral reefs, herbivorous fish play an essential role in
   regulating algal growth and influencing the outcome of coral-algal
   competition. Working on a remote predator-dominated coral reef on
   Palmyra Atoll, USA, we used behavioral foraging observations to quantify
   the roles of common parrotfish and surgeonfish in the roving herbivore
   guild. We recorded species-specific bite rates on different benthic
   organisms, quantified the relative abundance of those benthic organisms,
   and estimated benthos-specific grazing intensities as a function of bite
   rates, fish abundance, and percent cover. These grazing metrics were
   compared between the exposed fore reef (similar to 10 m depth) and
   protected reef terrace (similar to 5 m depth) habitats. We observed
   large differences in feeding rates and substrate selectivity among fish
   species. Most species fed predominately on algal turfs; however, some
   species foraged broadly among fleshy macroalgal taxa, while others
   specialized on calcified green algae of the genus Halimeda. The highest
   bite rates were recorded from species targeting algal turfs, while the
   highest rates of defecation were recorded from species targeting
   Halimeda. Per capita bite rates of all species were higher in the fore
   reef habitat (mean 45\% more bites min(-1)); however, overall grazing
   intensities on turf algae (bites cm(-2) d(-1)) were 5 times higher on
   the reef terrace than on the fore reef. Despite habitat-specific
   differences in the herbivore assemblages, the estimated distribution of
   total bites showed consistency among habitats, with strong guild-level
   positive foraging selectivity for algal turf. Comparisons of bite and
   defecation rate data for these herbivores across the Indo-Pacific
   highlight phylogenetic constraints on grazing activities. Overall, this
   study illustrates the importance of herbivore functional redundancy,
   variability in species-specific grazing, and provides a framework for
   assessing guild-wide grazing impacts on coral reefs.},

Title = {Lyngbyabellins K-N from Two Palmyra Atoll Collections of the Marine

Abstract = {Five lipopeptides of the lyngbyabellin structure class, four cyclic (13
   and 5) and one linear (4), were isolated from the extracts of two
   collections of filamentous marine cyanobacteria obtained from the
   Palmyra Atoll in the Central Pacific Ocean. Their planar structures and
   absolute configurations were elucidated through a combination of
   spectroscopic and chromatographic analyses as well as chemical synthesis
   of fragments. In addition to structural features typical of the
   lyngbyabellins, such as two thiazole rings and a chlorinated
   2-methyloctanoate residue, these new compounds possess several unique
   aspects. Of note, metabolites 2 and 3 possess rare monochlorination on
   the 3-acyloxy-2-methyloctanoate residue, whereas lyngbyabellin N (5) has
   an unusual N,N-dimethylvaline terminus. Lyngbyabellin N also possesses a
   leucine statine residue and shows strong cytotoxic activity against the
   HCT116 colon cancer cell line (IC50 = 40.9?+/-?3.3 nM).},

Title = {Gross and microscopic morphology of lesions in Cnidaria from Palmyra
   Atoll, Central Pacific},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INVERTEBRATE PATHOLOGY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {106},
Number = {2},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {We conducted gross and microscopic characterizations of lesions in
   Cnidaria from Palmyra Atoll, Central Pacific. We found growth anomalies
   (GA) to be the most commonly encountered lesion. Cases of discoloration
   and tissue loss were rare. GAs had a focal or multi-focal distribution
   and were predominantly nodular, exophytic, and umbonate. In
   scleractinians, the majority of GAs manifested as hyperplasia of the
   basal body wall (52\% of cases), with an associated absence or reduction
   of polyp structure (mesenteries and filaments, actinopharynx and
   tentacles), and depletion of zooxanthellae in the gastrodermis of the
   upper body wall. In the soft corals Sinularia sp. and Lobophytum sp.,
   GAs exclusively manifested as prominent hyperplasia of the coenenchyme
   with an increased density of solenia. In contrast to scleractinians,
   soft coral GAs displayed an inflammatory and necrotizing component with
   marked edema of the mesoglea, accompanied by infiltrates of
   variably-sized granular amoebocytes. Fungi, algae, sponges, and
   Crustacea were present in some scleractinian GAs, but absent in soft
   coral GAs. Fragmentation of tissues was a common finding in Acropora
   acuminata and Montipora cf. dilatata colonies with tissue loss, although
   no obvious causative agents were seen. Discoloration in the zoanthid,
   Palythoa tuberculosa, was found to be the result of necrosis, while in
   Lobophytum sp. discoloration was the result of zooxanthellar depletion
   (bleaching). Soft corals with discoloration or tissue loss showed a
   marked inflammatory response, however no obvious causative organisms
   were seen. Lesions that appeared similar at the gross level were
   revealed to be distinct by microscopy, emphasizing the importance of
   histopathology. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {The coconut palm, Cocos nucifera, impacts forest composition and soil
   characteristics at Palmyra Atoll, Central Pacific},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {21},
Number = {6},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Question
   Cocos nucifera, the coconut palm, has a pantropical distribution and
   reaches near monodominance in many atolls, low lying islands and coastal
   regions. This paper examines the ecological correlation between C.
   nucifera abundance and changes in forest structure, floristic diversity
   and forest soil characteristics.
   Location
   Palmyra Atoll NWR (USA), Central Pacific Ocean.
   Methods
   Plant surveys were conducted on 83 transects (each 100 m2). All plants
   >= 5 cm in height were identified and counted; large plants were also
   measured and ground cover was surveyed. Major macronutrients, pH,
   macro-elements/base cations, micronutrients and pedogenic elements, and
   thermodynamic stability levels were quantified from soil samples taken
   at each transect.
   Results
   Even in a low diversity atoll environment, we found that high abundances
   of C. nucifera corresponded with pronounced differences in forest
   communities including: lower diversity of established trees and
   regenerating understorey; higher stem density and stand basal area;
   lower abundance of major macronutrients; and differences in macro and
   trace elements and energy content of soil organic matter. Historical
   natural experiments document that the expansion of C. nucifera was the
   likely causative agent of these changes.
   Discussion
   Cumulatively, these data show that C. nucifera has important impacts on
   floristic, structural and soil characteristics of forests where it
   becomes dominant. Given the high proportion of tropical coastal areas in
   which C. nucifera is now naturalized and abundant, this likely has
   important implications for coastal forest diversity and structure.},

Abstract = {Acoustic recordings from Palmyra Atoll, northern Line Islands, central
   Pacific, showed upsweep frequency modulated pulses reminiscent of those
   produced by beaked whales. These signals had higher frequencies, broader
   bandwidths, longer pulse durations and shorter inter-pulse intervals
   than previously described pulses of Blainville's, Cuvier's and Gervais'
   beaked whales {[}Zimmer (2005). J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 117, 3919-3927;
   Johnson (2006). J. Exp. Biol. 209, 5038-5050; Gillespie (2009). J.
   Acoust. Soc. Am. 125, 3428-3433]. They were distinctly different
   temporally and spectrally from the unknown beaked whale at Cross
   Seamount, HI {[}McDonald (2009). J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 125, 624-627].
   Genetics on beaked whale specimens found at Palmyra Atoll suggest the
   presence of a poorly known beaked whale species. Mesoplodon sp. might be
   the source of the FM pulses described in this paper. The Palmyra Atoll
   FM pulse peak frequency was at 44 kHz with a -10 dB bandwidth of 26 kHz.
   Mean pulse duration was 355 mu s and inter-pulse interval was 225 ms,
   with a bimodal distribution. Buzz sequences were detected with
   inter-pulse intervals below 20 ms and unmodulated spectra, with about 20
   dB lower amplitude than prior FM pulses. These clicks had a 39 kHz
   bandwidth (-10 dB), peak frequency at 37 kHz, click duration 155 mu s,
   and inter-click interval between 4 and 10 ms. (C) 2010 Acoustical

Abstract = {Black rats (Rattus rattus) and their stomach nematodes (Mastophorus

   central Pacific Line Islands. To investigate patterns of parasitism, we
   trapped rats and quantified nematodes on 13 islets of various sizes and
   habitat types. Most rats were parasitized (59\%) with an average of 12
   worms per infected rat. Islet size did not greatly influence parasite
   population biology. Nematodes also did not appear to affect rat
   condition (weight to skull length). The only strong and consistent
   factor associated with the mean abundance of nematodes in rats was
   habitat (dominant cover and locally dominant plant species). Thus,
   nematodes were much more abundant in rats from sites dominated by
   coconut trees (Cocos nucifera). Coconut trees may also be an introduced
   species at Palmyra Atoll.},

Title = {Scale-dependent effects of habitat on movements and path structure of

Abstract = {The effects of habitat on the ecology, movements, and foraging
   strategies of marine apex predators are largely unknown. We used
   acoustic telemetry to quantify the movement patterns of blacktip reef
   sharks (Carcharhinus melanopterus) at Palmyra Atoll National Wildlife
   Refuge, in the Pacific Ocean. Sharks had relatively small home ranges
   over a timescale of days to weeks (0.55 +/- 0.24 km(2)) and showed
   strong site fidelity to sand-flat ledges within the west lagoon over a
   three-year period. Sharks showed evidence of diel and tidal movements,
   and they utilized certain regions of the west lagoon disproportionately.
   There were ontogenetic shifts in habitat selection, with smaller sharks
   showing greater selection for sand-flat habitats, and pups (total length
   35-61 cm) utilizing very shallow waters on sand-flats, potentially as
   nursery areas. Adult sharks selected ledge habitats and had lower rates
   of movement when over sand-flats and ledges than they did over lagoon
   waters. Fractal analysis of movements showed that over periods of days,
   sharks used patches that were 3-17\% of the scale of their home range.
   Repeat horizontal movements along ledge habitats consisted of relatively
   straight movements, which theoretical models consider the most efficient
   search strategy when forage patches may be spatially and temporally
   unpredictable. Although sharks moved using a direct walk while in
   patches, they appeared to move randomly between patches. Microhabitat
   quantity and quality had large effects on blacktip reef shark movements,
   which have consequences for the life-history characteristics of the
   species and potentially the spatial distribution of behaviorally
   mediated effects on lower trophic levels throughout the Palmyra
   ecosystem.},

Title = {Near-surface mixing and pronounced deep-water stratification in a

Volume = {30},

Abstract = {Palmyra Atoll has four partially isolated lagoons up to 50 m in depth,
   each with complex and variable bottom topographies. Measurements of
   depth, temperature, salinity, turbidity and dissolved oxygen (DO)
   revealed a well-mixed shallow surface layer (0-10 m depth) and below
   that pronounced stratification of DO in the absence of a pycnocline.
   Turbidity increased in a step-like manner at similar to 5 m depth, at
   the oxycline. For all deep sections of the lagoon (> 30 m), DO declined
   uniformly to 0\% saturation. As determined from filtration, mass of
   particulates was independent of depth. Surface mixing and deep-water
   stratification are both stable at different temporal scales, including
   day versus night, daily, weekly and annually. We suggest that lagoon
   circulation is represented by a shallow, westward-moving surface layer
   of well-to-partially mixed water with high DO and low turbidity,
   underlain by a relatively static and temporally stable layer with low to
   zero DO and elevated turbidity. This is the first report of such
   conditions within a deep lagoon system, and only the second report of
   anoxic conditions in any such system. In deep-water, stable euxinic
   conditions reflect bottom topography, with dysoxic and anoxic water
   being constrained within silled basins. The occurrence and depth of
   large volumes of sediment-laden and dysoxic/anoxic water need to be
   considered in management proposals designed to increase water flow
   through the lagoon. These novel water column conditions most probably
   arose as a consequence of military construction work, consistent with
   published reports of profound changes to the atoll during 1940-1945. If
   so, they highlight the need to better understand the possible
   consequences of cutting channels and modification of lagoon flow at many
   atolls across the central Pacific Ocean.},

Title = {Impacts of rodent eradication on seed predation and plant community

Abstract = {Invasive rodent eradications are frequently undertaken to curb island
   biodiversity loss. However, the breadth of rodents' ecological impact,
   even after eradication, is not always fully recognized. For example, the
   most widespread invasive rodent, the black rat (Rattus rattus), while
   omnivorous, eats predominantly seeds and fruit. Yet, the effects of seed
   predation release after eradication on plant communities and ecological
   functions are not well understood, posing a gap for island restoration.
   We examined the role of seed predation release following black rat
   eradication in changes to tree composition and aboveground biomass
   across an islet network (Palmyra Atoll) in the Central Pacific. We
   conducted repeated surveys of seed, juvenile, and adult tree biomass and
   survival in permanent vegetation plots before and after the eradication
   of rats. We observed a 95\% reduction in seed predation for an
   introduced, previously cultivated tree population (Cocos nucifera).
   Juvenile tree biomass of all species increased 14-fold, withC.
   nuciferaincreasing the most, suggesting that eradication increased this
   tree's competitive advantage. Indeed, based on stage-structured
   demographic models, rat eradication led to a 10\% increase inC.
   nuciferapopulation growth rate. The effect of invasive rodent seed
   predation varies considerably among the plant species in a community and
   can shift competitive dynamics, sometimes in favor of invasive plants.
   These bottom-up effects should be considered in evaluating the costs and
   benefits of eradication. Documenting the variation in invasive rodent
   diet items, along with long-term surveys, can help prioritize island
   eradications where restoration is most likely to be successful.},

Title = {Intercolony delta O-18 and Sr/Ca variability among Porites spp. corals

Abstract = {Quantitative estimates of natural climate variability are required to
   detect anthropogenic climate trends in the tropical Pacific; however,
   instrumental records from this region are too short and scarce. Coral
   oxygen isotopic (delta O-18) and strontium to calcium (Sr/Ca) records
   are often used to extend instrumental observations; however, differences
   in the mean Sr/Ca and delta O-18 values of Porites spp. colonies from
   the same reef can introduce large uncertainties in coral-based climate
   reconstructions. To quantify intercolony variability at Palmyra Atoll,
   we generate monthly resolved Sr/Ca and delta O-18 time series from five
   Porites spp. colonies that grew between 1980 and 2010. Monthly to
   interannual variability in Sr/Ca and delta O-18 is well-reproduced among
   different colonies; however, we document intercolony offsets in mean
   Sr/Ca of +/- 0.09 mmol/mol (1 sigma) or similar to 1 degrees C, and in
   mean delta O-18 of +/- 0.12 parts per thousand (1s) or similar to 0.1
   degrees C. The sensitivity of each proxy to climate also varies across
   colonies, with Sr/Ca-SST slopes ranging from -0.06 to -0.1 mmol mol(-1)
   degrees C-1 and delta O-18-SST slopes ranging from -0.25 to -0.35 parts
   per thousand degrees C-1. Intercolony variability in both coral Sr/Ca
   and delta O-18 reduces the reproducibility of coral-based delta O-18(sw)
   reconstructions across overlapping colonies. Accounting for both
   intercolony variability and slope error suggests that SST
   reconstructions using Sr/Ca from a single Palmyra coral have an
   uncertainty of +/- 1.3 degrees C (1 sigma); however, replicating Sr/Ca
   records across multiple colonies can greatly reduce this uncertainty. A
   composite Sr/Ca record built using five modern cores, for example,
   offers a reduced error of +/- 0.6 degrees C (1 sigma) in mean SST
   reconstructions, similar to 2.5 times smaller than errors associated
   with reconstructions from single corals.},

Abstract = {Animal movements can facilitate important ecological processes, and
   wide-ranging marine predators, such as sharks, potentially contribute
   significantly towards nutrient transfer between habitats. We applied
   network theory to 4 years of acoustic telemetry data for grey reef
   sharks (Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos) at Palmyra, an unfished atoll, to
   assess their potential role in nutrient dynamics throughout this remote
   ecosystem. We evaluated the dynamics of habitat connectivity and used
   network metrics to quantify shark-mediated nutrient distribution.
   Predator movements were consistent within year, but differed between
   years and by sex. Females used higher numbers of routes throughout the
   system, distributing nutrients over a larger proportion of the atoll.
   Extrapolations of tagged sharks to the population level suggest that
   prey consumption and subsequent egestion leads to the heterogeneous
   deposition of 94.5 kg d(-1) of nitrogen around the atoll, with
   approximately 86\% of this probably derived from pelagic resources.
   These results suggest that sharks may contribute substantially to
   nutrient transfer from offshore waters to near-shore reefs, subsidies
   that are important for coral reef health.},

Abstract = {Competition for fresh water between native and introduced plants is one
   important challenge facing native forests as rainfall variability
   increases. Competition can be especially acute for vegetation on Pacific
   atolls, which depend upon consistent rainfall to replenish shallow
   groundwater stores. Patterns of sap flow, water use, and diameter growth
   of Pisonia grandis trees were investigated on Sand Islet, Palmyra Atoll,
   Line Islands, during a period of low rainfall. Sap flow in the outer
   sapwood was reduced by 53\% for P. grandis trees growing within coconut
   palm (Cocos nucifera) stands (n=9) versus away from coconut palm (n=9).
   This suggested that water uptake was being limited by coconut palm.
   Radial patterns of sap flow into the sapwood of P. grandis also differed
   between stands with and without coconut palm, such that individual tree
   water use for P. grandis ranged from 14 to 67Lday(-1), averaging
   478Lday(-1) without coconut palm and 236Lday(-1) with coconut palm.
   Diameter growth of P. grandis was measured from nine islets. In contrast
   to sap flow, competition with coconut palm increased diameter growth by
   89\%, equating to an individual tree basal area increment of 54 versus
   103mm(2)day(-1). Greater diameter growth countered by lower rates of
   water use by P. grandis trees growing in competition with coconut palm
   suggests that stem swell may be associated with water storage when
   positioned in the understory of coconut palm, and may facilitate
   survival when water becomes limiting until too much shading overwhelms
   P. grandis. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Title = {Host tolerance, not symbiont tolerance, determines the distribution of

   atoll},
Journal = {CORAL REEFS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {31},

Pages = {389-398},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Tolerance of environmental variables differs between corals and their
   dinoflagellate symbionts (Symbiodinium spp.), controlling the
   holobiont's (host and symbiont combined) resilience to environmental
   stress. However, the ecological role that environmental variables play
   in holobiont distribution remains poorly understood. We compared the
   drivers of symbiont and coral species distributions at Palmyra Atoll, a
   location with a range of reef environments from low to high sediment
   concentrations (1-52 g dry weight m(-2) day(-1)). We observed uniform
   holobiont partnerships across the atoll (e.g. Montipora spp. with
   Symbiodinium type C15 at all sites). Multivariate analysis revealed that
   field-based estimates of settling sediment predominantly explained the
   spatial variation of coral species among sites (P < 0.01). However, none
   of the environmental variables measured (sedimentation, temperature,
   chlorophyll concentration, salinity) affected symbiont distribution. The
   discord between environmental variables and symbiont distributions
   suggests that the symbionts are physiologically tolerant of the variable
   environmental regime across this location and that the distribution of
   different host-symbiont combinations present is largely dependent on
   coral rather than Symbiodinium physiology. The data highlight the
   importance of host tolerance to environmental stressors, which should be
   considered simultaneously with symbiont sensitivity when considering the
   impact of variations in environmental conditions on coral communities.},

Abstract = {Reef islands of Palmyra Atoll in the northern Line Islands, equatorial
   Pacific Ocean, underwent mainly minor natural changes in shape and size
   between 1874 and 1940. Many major changes occurred between 1940 and 1945
   when military construction created a dredged channel into the lagoon,
   enlarged several islands, joined most islands around the lagoon system
   into a continuous roadway, constructed a causeway separating two
   lagoons, and created several new islands. Overall, land area
   approximately doubled and land volume approximately trebled during this
   period, and the construction affected water circulation between reef
   flats and lagoons. Since 1945, the atoll has been largely uninhabited,
   construction and most maintenance of the newly-created shoreline has
   ceased, and coastlines of larger islands have simplified by infilling of
   bays and erosion of promontories, at net rates of up to 1.8 m/y.
   Narrower land masses have been broken into multiple smaller arcuate
   islands with intervening shallow channels. Sediment moves mainly
   westward along ocean coasts, into lagoons on lagoon coasts, and via
   tidal currents where causeways have been breached. In the east, Barren
   Island appeared and began growing from natural causes well before
   military construction. After purchase by The Nature Conservancy, the
   atoll was designated a U.S. National Wildlife Refuge in 2001. This
   protection offers the opportunity to observe coastal processes operating
   in the absence of the efforts to protect infrastructure typically
   associated with inhabited atolls.},

Title = {A coupled wave-hydrodynamic model of an atoll with high friction:
   Mechanisms for flow, connectivity, and ecological implications},
Journal = {OCEAN MODELLING},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {110},
Pages = {66-82},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {We present a hydrodynamic analysis of an atoll system from modeling
   simulations using a coupled wave and three-dimensional hydrodynamic
   model (COAWST) applied to Palmyra Atoll in the Central Pacific. This is
   the first time the vortex force formalism has been applied in a highly
   frictional reef environment. The model results agree well with field
   observations considering the model complexity in terms of bathymetry,
   bottom roughness, and forcing (waves, wind, metrological, tides,
   regional boundary conditions), and open boundary conditions. At the
   atoll scale, strong regional flows create flow separation and a
   well-defined wake, similar to 2D flow past a cylinder. Circulation
   within the atoll is typically forced by waves and tides, with strong
   waves from the north driving flow from north to south across the atoll,
   and from east to west through the lagoon system. Bottom stress is
   significant for depths less than about 60 m, and in addition to the
   model bathymetry, is important for correct representation of flow in the
   model. Connectivity within the atoll system shows that the general
   trends follow the mean flow paths. However, some connectivity exists
   between all regions of the atoll system due to nonlinear processes such
   as eddies and tidal phasing. Moderate wave stress, short travel time
   (days since entering the reef system), and low temperature appear to be
   the most ideal conditions for high coral cover at this site. (C) 2016

Abstract = {Strain OCN044(T) was isolated from the homogenised tissue and mucus of
   an apparently healthy Acropora cytherea coral fragment collected from
   the western reef terrace of Palmyra Atoll in the Northern Line Islands
   and was taxonomically evaluated with a polyphasic approach. The
   morphological and chemotaxonomic properties are consistent with
   characteristics of the genus Vibrio: Gram-stain-negative rods, oxidase-
   and catalase-positive, and motile by means of a polar flagellum. Strain
   OCN044(T) can be differentiated as a novel subspecies based on 21
   differences among chemotaxonomic features (e.g., fatty acids percentages
   for C-12:0 and C-18:1 omega 7c), enzymatic activities (e.g., DNase and
   cystine arylamidase), and carbon sources utilized (e.g., L-xylose and
   D-melezitose) from its nearest genetic relative. Phylogenetic analysis
   and genomic comparisons show close evolutionary relatedness to Vibrio
   tetraodonis A511(T) but the overall genomic relatedness indices identify
   strain OCN044(T) as a distinct subspecies. Based on a polyphasic
   characterisation, differences in genomic and taxonomic data, strain
   OCN044(T) represents a novel subspecies of V. tetraodonis A511(T), for
   which the name Vibrio tetraodonis subsp. pristinus subsp. nov. is
   proposed. The type strain is OCN044(T) (= LMG 31895(T) = DSM 111778(T)).},

Title = {Transforming Palmyra Atoll to native-tree dominance will increase net
   carbon storage and reduce dissolved organic carbon reef runoff},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {17},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 21},
Abstract = {Native forests on tropical islands have been displaced by non-native
   species, leading to calls for their transformation. Simultaneously,
   there is increasing recognition that tropical forests can help sequester
   carbon that would otherwise enter the atmosphere. However, it is unclear
   if native forests sequester more or less carbon than human-altered
   landscapes. At Palmyra Atoll, efforts are underway to transform the
   rainforest composition from coconut palm (Cocos nucifera) dominated to
   native mixed-species. To better understand how this landscape-level
   change will alter the atoll's carbon dynamics, we used field sampling,
   remote sensing, and parameter estimates from the literature to model the
   total carbon accumulation potential of Palmyra's forest before and after
   transformation. The model predicted that replacing the C. nucifera
   plantation with native species would reduce aboveground biomass from
   692.6 to 433.3 Mg C. However, expansion of the native Pisonia grandis
   and Heliotropium foertherianum forest community projected an increase in
   soil carbon to at least 13,590.8 Mg C, thereby increasing the atoll's
   overall terrestrial carbon storage potential by 11.6\%. Nearshore sites
   adjacent to C. nucifera canopy had a higher dissolved organic carbon
   (DOC) concentration (110.0 mu MC) than sites adjacent to native forest
   (81.5 mu MC), suggesting that, in conjunction with an increase in
   terrestrial carbon storage, replacing C. nucifera with native forest
   will reduce the DOC exported from the forest into in nearshore marine
   habitats. Lower DOC levels have potential benefits for corals and coral
   dependent communities. For tropical islands like Palmyra, reverting from
   C. nucifera dominance to native tree dominance could buffer projected
   climate change impacts by increasing carbon storage and reducing coral
   disease.},

Title = {Changes in benthic community composition associated with the outbreak of
   the corallimorph, Rhodactis howesii, at Palmyra Atoll},

Abstract = {Few studies have documented the spatial and temporal dynamics of highly
   invasive species in coral reef benthic communities. Here, we quantified
   the ecological dynamics of invasion by a corallimorph, Rhodactis
   howesii, at Palmyra Atoll in the central Pacific. A localized outbreak
   of this species was first observed following a shipwreck at Palmyra in
   1991 and has subsequently spread across hectares, reaching 100\% cover
   in some areas. We examined the spatial and temporal dynamics of this
   invasion, and its impact on the benthic community, using a combination
   of permanent photoquadrats and large-scale photomosaic imagery. Our data
   revealed two distinct patterns in the spatial dynamics of R. howesii on
   the reef. First, following the removal of the shipwreck in 2013, the
   cover of the corallimorph in the immediate vicinity of the wreck
   decreased markedly, with crustose coralline algae (CCA), an important
   reef-builder, dominating the newly available substrate. However, in
   contrast to the decline at the epicenter of the invasion, the
   corallimorph has spread to additional sites around the atoll where
   increases in abundance have been associated with decreases in hard coral
   cover. Reductions in percent cover and corallimorph patch size near the
   epicenter of the outbreak, coupled with increases in cover and patch
   size and appearance of the corallimorph at other locations around
   Palmyra, demonstrate the dynamic nature of this ``invasion.{''} Further,
   we found that the corallimorph settled disproportionately often on
   patches of turf or CCA cover, but can then overgrow all benthic
   competitors following establishment. This study provides evidence that
   R. howesii has the capacity to be highly invasive on coral reefs and
   highlights the importance of large-scale, long-term monitoring efforts
   to capture the dynamic nature of such invasions.},

Title = {Local extinction of the Asian tiger mosquito (Aedes albopictus)
   following rat eradication on Palmyra Atoll},
Journal = {BIOLOGY LETTERS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {14},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus, appears to have been
   extirpated from Palmyra Atoll following rat eradication. Anecdotal
   biting reports, collection records, and regular captures in black-light
   traps showed the species was present before rat eradication. Since then,
   there have been no biting reports and no captures over 2 years of
   extensive trapping (black-light and scent traps). By contrast, the
   southern house mosquito, Culex quinquefasciatus, was abundant before and
   after rat eradication. We hypothesize that mammals were a substantial
   and preferred blood meal for Aedes, whereas Culex feeds mostly on
   seabirds. Therefore, after rat eradication, humans and seabirds alone
   could not support positive population growth or maintenance of Aedes.
   This seems to be the first documented accidental secondary extinction of
   a mosquito. Furthermore, it suggests that preferred host abundance can
   limit mosquito populations, opening new directions for controlling
   important disease vectors that depend on introduced species like rats.},

Title = {Non-target species mortality and the measurement of brodifacoum

Abstract = {The use of rodenticides to control or eradicate invasive rats (Rattus
   spp.) for conservation purposes has rapidly grown in the past decades,
   especially on islands. The non-target consequences and the fate of
   toxicant residue from such rodent eradication operations have not been
   well explored. In a cooperative effort, we monitored the application of
   a rodenticide, `Brodifacoum 25W: Conservation', during an attempt to
   eradicate Rattus rattus from Palmyra Atoll. In 2011, Brodifacoum 25W:
   Conservation was aerially broadcasted twice over the entire atoll (2.5
   km(2)) at rates of 80 kg/ha and 75 kg/ha and a supplemental hand
   broadcast application (71.6 kg/ha) occurred three weeks after the second
   aerial application over a 10 ha area. We documented brodifacoum residues
   in soil, water, and biota, and documented mortality of non-target
   organisms. Some bait (14-19\% of the target application rate) entered
   the marine environment to distances 7 m from the shore. After the
   application commenced, carcasses of 84 animals representing 15 species
   of birds, fish, reptiles and invertebrates were collected
   opportunistically as potential non-target mortalities. In addition,
   fish, reptiles, and invertebrates were systematically collected for
   residue analysis. Brodifacoum residues were detected in most (84.3\%) of
   the animal samples analyzed. Although detection of residues in samples
   was anticipated, the extent and concentrations in many parts of the food
   web were greater than expected. Risk assessments should carefully
   consider application rates and entire food webs prior to operations
   using rodenticides. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Abstract = {Baits containing brodifacoum rodenticide were aerially applied to
   eradicate invasive black rats from Palmyra Atoll, an important
   biodiversity center. Bait application must be sufficient to be
   effective, while minimizing environmental hazards by not exceeding
   designated label rates, prompting our bait density assessments for two
   aerial drops. With few physical or human resources on this remote,
   uninhabited atoll, assessments were particularly challenging, requiring
   observations within 30 min of aerial application to avoid bait loss to
   rats, crabs, or elements. We estimated bait density using quadrat
   sampling within 13 terrestrial sampling areas. We also sampled 10 tidal
   flat areas to assess inadvertent bait scatter into marine aquatic
   environments. Of particular value for challenging sampling
   circumstances, our quadrats had to be lightweight and durable, which we
   addressed by using widely available PVC hoops ({''}Hula Hoops{''}), the
   size of which was ideal for sampling purposes. At 77.5 and 78.7 kg/ha,
   overall bait densities were very near to the target densities of 80 and
   75 kg/ha, respectively. However, considerable variability in bait
   densities existed among sampled areas, 8.6-178.2 and 31.4-129.5 kg/ha
   for the respective drops, respectively. Environmental, human, and
   equipment factors likely accounted for this variability. Tidal flat
   sampling revealed variable bait scatter into aquatic environments, from
   0-46.3 kg/ha across the two drops. No differences were found in average
   bait densities among 1-, 4-, and 7-m distances from high tide lines. Our
   methods might broadly assist bait density (and other) surveys under
   challenging circumstances.},

Abstract = {Although many studies on the taxonomy of digenean trematodes of marine
   fishes have been completed in the Eastern Indo-Pacific (EIP) marine
   ecoregion, only a few have considered metacercarial stages. Here, the
   results are presented of a taxonomic survey of the digenean
   metacercariae of fishes from Palmyra Atoll, a remote and relatively
   pristine US National Wildlife Refuge located 1680 km SSW of Hawaii. Up
   to 425 individual fish were collected, comprising 42 fish species, from
   the sand flats bordering the lagoon of the atoll. Quantitative
   parasitological examinations of each fish were performed. Morphological
   descriptions of the encountered digenean metacercariae are provided,
   together with their prevalence, mean intensities, host and tissue-use.
   Up to 33,964 individuals were recovered representing 19 digenean
   metacercaria species from eight families. The species composition of
   digeneans in lagoon fishes at Palmyra Atoll is a subset of what has
   previously been reported for the EIP. Further, the large diversity and
   abundance of metacercariae reported in this study highlight the utility
   of including this group in future ecological research in the EIP marine
   ecoregion.},

Title = {Application of the littoral cell concept to managing a protected atoll:
   Palmyra Atoll National Wildlife Refuge},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {52},
Number = {12},

Abstract = {The recognition of littoral sediment cells has proven valuable to
   coastal zone management in many areas of the world because it emphasises
   that sediment transport and deposition relate to physical processes
   rather than to administrative boundaries and that sedimentary units are
   self-contained. To date, cells identified for shoreline management
   planning are often extensive, extending for tens to hundreds of km. We
   suggest that the concept is also applicable to the management of atoll
   coastlines which, although spatially very small overall, consist of
   isolated segments with efficient intervening sediment sinks. As an
   example, Palmyra Atoll, a protected wildlife refuge in the northern Line
   Islands, is undergoing natural major changes resulting from
   sediment-related processes. Defining sediment cells as integral parts of
   management units here will aid decision-making necessary for the
   protection of specific areas, potentially giving savings in research
   effort and remedial costs and minimising disruption to other sensitive
   areas of the reserve. Similar benefits would apply to the management of
   the coastlines of other atolls. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Reef Fishes Have Higher Parasite Richness at Unfished Palmyra Atoll
   Compared to Fished Kiritimati Island},
Journal = {ECOHEALTH},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {5},
Number = {3},
Pages = {338-345},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {We compared parasite communities at two coral atolls in the Line Islands
   chain of the central Pacific (Kiritimati Island and Palmyra Atoll).
   Palmyra Atoll is relatively pristine while Kiritimati Island is heavily
   fished. At each island, we sampled five fish species for helminth and
   arthropod endoparasites: Chromis margaritifer, Plectroglyphidodon
   dickii, Paracirrhites arcatus, Acanthurus nigricans, and Lutjanus bohar.
   The surveys found monogeneans, digeneans, cestodes, nematodes,
   acanthocephalans, and copepods. Parasite richness was higher at Palmyra
   compared to Kiritimati for all five fish species. Fishes from Palmyra
   also tended to have more parasites species per host, higher parasite
   prevalence, and higher parasite abundance than did fishes from
   Kiritimati. The lower parasitism at Kiritimati may result from a
   simplified food web due to over fishing. Low biodiversity could impair
   parasite transmission by reducing the availability of hosts required by
   parasites with complex life cycles. Most notably, the lower abundances
   of larval shark tapeworms at Kiritimati presumably reflect the fact that
   fishing has greatly depleted sharks there in comparison to Palmyra.},

Title = {Phase Shift from a Coral to a Corallimorph-Dominated Reef Associated
   with a Shipwreck on Palmyra Atoll},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {3},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG 20},
Abstract = {Coral reefs can undergo relatively rapid changes in the dominant biota,
   a phenomenon referred to as phase shift. Various reasons have been
   proposed to explain this phenomenon including increased human
   disturbance, pollution, or changes in coral reef biota that serve a
   major ecological function such as depletion of grazers. However,
   pinpointing the actual factors potentially responsible can be
   problematic. Here we show a phase shift from coral to the
   corallimorpharian Rhodactis howesii associated with a long line vessel
   that wrecked in 1991 on an isolated atoll (Palmyra) in the central
   Pacific Ocean. We documented high densities of R. howesii near the ship
   that progressively decreased with distance from the ship whereas R.
   howesii were rare to absent in other parts of the atoll. We also
   confirmed high densities of R. howesii around several buoys recently
   installed on the atoll in 2001. This is the first time that a phase
   shift on a coral reef has been unambiguously associated with man-made
   structures. This association was made, in part, because of the
   remoteness of Palmyra and its recent history of minimal human habitation
   or impact. Phase shifts can have long-term negative ramification for
   coral reefs, and eradication of organisms responsible for phase shifts
   in marine ecosystems can be difficult, particularly if such organisms
   cover a large area. The extensive R. howesii invasion and subsequent
   loss of coral reef habitat at Palmyra also highlights the importance of
   rapid removal of shipwrecks on corals reefs to mitigate the potential of
   reef overgrowth by invasives.},

Title = {Arthropod surveys on Palmyra Atoll, line Islands, and insights into the

Journal = {PACIFIC SCIENCE},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {61},

Pages = {485-502},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Palmyra Atoll, in the Line Islands of the equatorial Pacific, supports
   one of the largest remaining native stands of Pisonia grandis forest in
   the tropical Pacific Ocean. In 2003, we surveyed terrestrial arthropods
   to document extant native and introduced species richness, compare these
   lists with historical records, and assess potential threats to native
   species and ecosystem integrity. In total, 115 arthropod taxa were
   collected, bringing the total number of taxa recorded since 1913 to 162.
   Few native species were collected; most taxa were accidental
   introductions also recorded from the Hawaiian Islands, the presumed main
   source of introductions to Palmyra. The overlap with previous historical
   Surveys in 1913 and 1948 was low (<40\%), and new species continue to
   establish, with one species of whitefly reaching pest status between
   2003 and 2005. We observed numerous dead or dying large Pisonia grandis,
   and the green scale Pulvinaria. urbicola (Coccidae) was particularly
   abundant on trees of poor health. Abundant introduced ants, particularly
   Pheidole megacephala, tended this and other hemipterans feeding on both
   native and introduced plants. We hypothesize that the
   Pheidole-Pulvinaria facultative mutualism is causing the decline of
   Pisonia grandis. Because of the unique properties of Pisonia grandis
   forest on oceanic atolls, its importance for nesting seabirds, and its
   alarming global decline, immediate conservation efforts should be
   directed at controlling introduced Hemiptera and disrupting their
   mutualisms with normative ants on Palmyra Atoll.},

Volume = {54},
Number = {3-4},
Pages = {460-473},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Two interdisciplinary cruises aimed at relating the ecology of marine
   fish populations to oceanographic conditions were fielded during the
   late summer and late winter seasons near Palmyra Atoll (5.9degreesN,
   162.1degreesW) in the Line Islands. Ocean current and hydrographic
   measurements revealed interaction of the flow with the steep topography.
   During the first cruise (August/September 1990) satellite-tracked
   surface drifters and acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP)
   measurements showed a strong eastward setting North Equatorial Counter
   Current (NECC) with maximum speeds exceeding I m s(-1) at 80 in depth
   approximately. This current turned southeastward on closer approach to
   Palmyra. The drifter paths exhibited excursions with zonal wavelength of
   approximately 250 km, meridional amplitude of 25 km and period of
   approximately 5 days. During the second cruise (February/March 1992),
   the ADCP-derived speeds of the NECC were weaker (maxima approximately 33
   cm s(-1)) while the relative geostrophic flow component was of magnitude
   similar to 1990 and the signal of zonal geostrophic currents reached
   much deeper to approximately 650 in depth (150 in in 1990). Doming
   isopycnals beneath the surface mixed layer as well as thick (10-25 m)
   internal mixed layers were found near Palmyra during both cruises, with
   slightly different positions relative to the island. The discontinuous
   vertical temperature profiles may have been a result of strong boundary
   mixing due to breaking internal waves on Palmyra's steep slopes. In the
   immediate vicinity of the island variations in flow speed,
   stratification and ``mixing{''} in both the alongshore and cross-isobath
   directions were observed. Overall, the current speeds were reduced
   during February/March 1992, the peak time of the 1991-1993 warm event in
   the tropical Pacific. While parameters of turbulent two-dimensional wake
   theory are suggestive of formation and shedding of eddies in the lee of
   the island, no direct observations of circular motions were made in
   either expedition.},

   the evidence that a recent transition has occurred from a coral- to
   sponge-dominated system. We found 24 sponge species in permanent
   quadrats in the lagoon between 2009 and 2011, and 11 species on our
   recruitment panels. The sponge assemblage composition and abundance did
   not vary significantly between years and appear stable. Many sponge
   recruits were found in both years that the panels were examined although
   higher rates were recorded in the second year of the study. While it
   seems very possible that a change to a sponge-dominated lagoon is
   associated with declining environmental quality at Palmyra as a result
   of modifications over 70years ago, without pre-modification data on reef
   assemblage composition this remains speculative. Our observations of
   short-term temporal stability in the sponge assemblages at Palmyra
   highlight the potential for sponge-dominated reef states to be
   maintained in degraded reef environments that are seemingly unsuitable
   for coral survival.},

Abstract = {We report field measurements of waves and currents made from September
   2011 to July 2014 on Palmyra Atoll in the central Pacific that were used
   in conjunction with the SWAN wave model to characterize the wave
   dynamics operant on the atoll. Our results indicate that wave energy is
   primarily from the north during the northern hemisphere winter and from
   the south in the northern hemisphere summer. Refraction of waves along
   the reef terraces due to variations in bathymetry leads to focusing of
   waves in specific locations. Bottom friction, modeled with a modified
   bottom roughness formulation, is the significant source of wave energy
   dissipation on the atoll, a result that is consistent with available
   observations of wave damping on Palmyra. Indeed modeled wave dissipation
   rates from bottom friction are on average larger than dissipation rates
   due to breaking and are an order of magnitude larger than what has been
   observed on other, less geometrically complex reefs, a result which
   should be corroborated with future in situ measurements. The SWAN wave
   model with a modified bottom friction formulation better predicts bulk
   wave energy properties than the existing formulation at our measurement
   stations. The near bed squared velocity, a proxy for bottom stress,
   shows strong spatial variability across the atoll and exerts control
   over geomorphic structure and benthic community composition.},

Title = {Trophic plasticity in a common reef-building coral: Insights from delta
   C-13 analysis of essential amino acids},

Abstract = {Reef-building corals are mixotrophic organisms that can obtain nutrition
   from endosymbiotic microalgae (autotrophy) and particle capture
   (heterotrophy). Heterotrophic nutrition is highly beneficial to many
   corals, particularly in times of stress. Yet, the extent to which
   different coral species rely on heterotrophic nutrition remains largely
   unknown because it is challenging to quantify. We developed a
   quantitative approach to investigate coral nutrition using carbon
   isotope (delta C-13) analysis of six essential amino acids (AA(ESS)) in
   a common Indo-Pacific coral (Pocillopora meandrina) from the fore reef
   habitat of Palmyra Atoll. We sampled particulate organic matter (POM)
   and zooplankton as the dominant heterotrophic food sources in addition
   to the coral host and endosymbionts. We also measured bulk tissue carbon
   (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) isotope values of each sample
   type. Patterns among delta C-13 values of individual AA(ESS) provided
   complete separation between the autotrophic (endosymbionts) and
   heterotrophic nutritional sources. In contrast, bulk tissue delta C-13
   and delta N-15 values were highly variable across the putative food
   sources and among the coral and endosymbiont fractions, preventing
   accurate estimates of coral nutrition on Palmyra. We used linear
   discriminant analysis to quantify differences among patterns of AA(ESS)
   delta C-13 values, or `fingerprints', of the food resources available to
   corals. This allowed for the development of a quantitative continuum of
   coral nutrition that can identify the relative contribution of
   autotrophic and heterotopic nutrition to individual colonies. Our
   approach revealed exceptional variation in conspecific colonies at
   scales of metres to kilometres. On average, 41\% of AA(ESS) in P.
   meandrina on Palmyra are acquired via heterotrophy, but some colonies
   appear capable of obtaining the majority of AA(ESS) from one source or
   the other. The use of AA(ESS) delta C-13 fingerprinting analysis offers
   a significant improvement on the current methods for quantitatively
   assessing coral trophic ecology. We anticipate that this approach will
   facilitate studies of coral nutrition in the field, which are essential
   for comparing coral trophic ecology across taxa and multiple spatial
   scales. Such information will be critical for understanding the role of
   heterotrophic nutrition in coral resistance and/or resilience to ongoing
   environmental change. A free Plain Language Summary can be found within

Title = {Small atoll fresh groundwater lenses respond to a combination of natural
   climatic cycles and human modified geology},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {756},
Month = {FEB 20},
Abstract = {Freshwater lenses underlying small ocean islands exhibit spatial
   variability and temporal fluctuations in volume, influencing ecologic
   management. For example, The Palmyra Atoll National Wildlife Refuge
   harbors one of the few surviving native stands of Pisonia grandis in the
   central Pacific Ocean, yet these trees face pressure from groundwater
   salinization, with little basic groundwater data to guide decision
   making. Adding to natural complexity, the geology of Palmyra was heavily
   altered by dredge and fill activities. Our study based at this atoll
   combines geophysical and hydrological field measurements from 2008 to
   2019 with groundwater modeling to study the drivers of observed
   freshwater lens dynamics. Electromagnetic induction (EMI) field data
   were collected on the main atoll islands over repeat transects in 2008
   following `strong' La Nifia conditions (wet) and in 2016 during `very
   strong' Cl Nitio conditions (dry). Shallow monitoring wells were
   installed adjacent to the geophysical transects in 2013 and screened
   within the fresh/saline groundwater transition zone. Temporal EMI and
   monitoring well data showed a strong contraction of the freshwater lens
   in response to El Nifio conditions, and indicated a thicker lens toward
   the ocean side, an opposite spatial pattern to that observed for many
   other Pacific islands. On an outer islet where a stand of mature Pisonia
   trees exist, EMI surveys revealed only a thin (<3 m from land surface)
   layer of brackish groundwater during Cl Nifio. Numerical groundwater
   simulations were performed for a range of permeability distributions and
   climate conditions at Palmyra. Results revealed that the observed
   atypical lens asymmetry is likely due to more efficient submarine
   groundwater discharge on the lagoon side as a result of lagoon dredging
   and filling with high-permeability material. Simulations also predict
   large decreases (40\%) in freshwater lens volume during dry cycles and
   highlight threats to the Pisonia trees, yielding insight for atoll
   ecosystem management worldwide. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Abstract = {We present results of the thermodynamics and hydrodynamics of an atoll
   system and their effect on coral cover based on field measurements from
   2012 to 2014 on Palmyra Atoll in the central Pacific. We found that
   spatial variations in coral cover were correlated with temperature
   variations on time scales of days to weeks. Shallow terrace and backreef
   sites with high coral cover (> 50\%) had a highly variable temperature
   distributions, but their average weekly temperature distributions were
   lower and similar to offshore waters. The mechanism for maintaining this
   low weekly temperature was mean advection, which varied on a weekly
   timescale in response to wave forcing. Tides were also important in
   driving flow on the atoll, but their contribution to the net transport
   of heat was not significant. Wind and regional forcing were generally
   not important in driving flow inside the atoll. Buoyancy-driven flows
   were important within the lagoons, and in driving cross-shore exchange
   on forereef environments. The physical factors favoring high coral cover
   percentage varied according to the different prevailing hydrodynamic
   regimes: low temperatures in backreef habitats, short travel times in
   lagoon habitats (days since entering the reef system), and lower wave
   stress on forereef habitats. In light of future warming from climate
   change, local areas of reefs which maintain lower temperatures through
   wave-driven mean flows will have the best likelihood of promoting coral
   survival.},

Title = {Differential plant damage due to litterfall in palm-dominated forest
   stands in a Central Pacific atoll},

Abstract = {High densities of palms are common in many tropical forests. In some
   cases, the dominance of palms has been associated with a depauperate
   understorey and high rates of native seedling mortality. A variety of
   different potential mechanisms has been suggested to explain the
   sustained palm dominance in the understorey and canopy of these forests.
   Working in a Cocos nucifera-dominated wet tropical forest at Palmyra
   Atoll in the central Pacific, we examine how litterfall from this
   pantropical, and economically important palm, impacts seedling survival.
   We compare rates of litterfall, and rates of litterfall-associated
   damage, between forest stands dominated by C. nucifera (coconut palm)
   and forest stands with low abundance of C. nucifera. To assess
   litterfall damage we survey damage to both artificial seedlings (n =
   711), outplanted real seedlings of two species (with and without
   protection via caging; n = 204), and standing rates of litterfall
   damage. We find that rates of large-litterfall damage were an average of
   five times higher in sites with high densities of C. nucifera.
   Associated with these increases we observe that levels of physical
   damage to artificial model seedlings caused by litterfall over a 4-mo
   period increased from 4.9\% in sites with low abundance of C. nucifera
   to 16.1\% in sites with high abundance of C. nucifera. Extrapolated to
   annual rates, litterfall damage of this magnitude exceeds the average
   levels observed in other published studies. Living native seedlings also
   showed more than 300\% higher levels of mortality in forest stands with
   high densities of C. nucifera, a difference that was greatly reduced
   when protected by caging from litterfall. In contrast, uncaged C.
   nucifera seedlings actually had slightly higher survivorship in habitats
   dominated by conspecifics. We suggest that litterfall damage may be an
   important mechanism by which this tropical palm reaches and maintains
   near monodominance in many coastal and insular habitats.},

Title = {Dermal denticle assemblages in coral reef sediments correlate with
   conventional shark surveys},
Journal = {METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {11},
Number = {3},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {It is challenging to assess long-term trends in mobile, long-lived and
   relatively rare species such as sharks. Despite ongoing declines in many
   coastal shark populations, conventional surveys might be too fleeting
   and too recent to describe population trends over decades to millennia.
   Placing recent shark declines into historical context should improve
   management efforts as well as our understanding of past ecosystem
   dynamics.
   A new palaeoecological approach for surveying shark abundance on coral
   reefs is to quantify dermal denticle assemblages preserved in sediments.
   This approach assumes that denticle accumulation rates correlate with
   shark abundances. Here, we test this assumption by comparing the
   denticle record in surface sediments to three conventional shark survey
   methods at Palmyra Atoll, Line Islands, central Pacific Ocean, where
   shark density is high and spatially heterogeneous.
   We generally found a significant positive correlation between denticle
   accumulation rates and shark abundances derived from underwater visual
   census, baited remote underwater video and hook and line surveys.
   Denticle accumulation rates reflected shark abundances, suggesting that
   denticle assemblages can preserve a signal of time-averaged shark
   abundance in low-energy coral reef environments. We offer suggestions
   for applying this tool to measure shark abundance over long time-scales
   in other contexts.},

Title = {The influence of habitat and adults on the spatial distribution of
   juvenile corals},
Journal = {ECOGRAPHY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {42},
Number = {10},
Pages = {1703-1713},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Population distributions are affected by a variety of spatial processes,
   including dispersal, intraspecific dynamics and habitat selection.
   Within reef-building coral communities, these processes are especially
   important during the earliest life stages when reproduction provides
   mobility among sessile organisms and populations experience the greatest
   mortality bottlenecks both before and immediately after settlement.
   Here, we used large-area imaging to create photomosaics that allowed us
   to identify and map the location of 4681 juvenile (1-5 cm diameter) and
   25 902 adult (>5 cm diameter) coral colonies from eight 100-m(2) plots
   across the forereef of Palmyra Atoll. Using metrics of density, percent
   cover and the relative location of each colony within each plot, we
   examined abundance and spatial relationships between juvenile and adult
   coral taxa. Within coral taxa, juvenile density was generally positively
   related to the numerical density and percent cover of adults. Nearest
   neighbor analyses showed aggregation of juveniles near adults of the
   same taxon for two of the focal taxa (Pocillopora and Fungiids), while
   all other taxa showed random spatial patterning relative to adults.
   Three taxa had clustered distributions of juveniles overall.
   Additionally, we found that on a colony level, juveniles for five of
   nine focal taxa (accounting for >98\% of all identified juveniles)
   associated with a specific habitat type, with four of those five taxa
   favoring unconsolidated (e.g. rubble) over consolidated substrata. The
   general lack of clustering in juvenile corals contrasts with consistent
   clustering patterns seen in adult corals, suggesting that adult spatial
   patterns are largely driven by processes occurring after maturity such
   as partial colony mortality, including fission and fragmentation. The
   association of many taxa with unconsolidated habitat also suggests that
   corals may play an important role in colonizing natural rubble patches
   that could contribute to reef stabilization over time.},

Title = {Large-area imaging reveals biologically driven non-random spatial
   patterns of corals at a remote reef},
Journal = {CORAL REEFS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {36},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1291-1305},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {For sessile organisms such as reef-building corals, differences in the
   degree of dispersion of individuals across a landscape may result from
   important differences in life-history strategies or may reflect patterns
   of habitat availability. Descriptions of spatial patterns can thus be
   useful not only for the identification of key biological and physical
   mechanisms structuring an ecosystem, but also by providing the data
   necessary to generate and test ecological theory. Here, we used an in
   situ imaging technique to create large-area photomosaics of 16 plots at
   Palmyra Atoll, central Pacific, each covering 100 m(2) of benthic
   habitat. We mapped the location of 44,008 coral colonies and identified
   each to the lowest taxonomic level possible. Using metrics of spatial
   dispersion, we tested for departures from spatial randomness. We also
   used targeted model fitting to explore candidate processes leading to
   differences in spatial patterns among taxa. Most taxa were clustered and
   the degree of clustering varied by taxon. A small number of taxa did not
   significantly depart from randomness and none revealed evidence of
   spatial uniformity. Importantly, taxa that readily fragment or tolerate
   stress through partial mortality were more clustered. With little
   exception, clustering patterns were consistent with models of
   fragmentation and dispersal limitation. In some taxa, dispersion was
   linearly related to abundance, suggesting density dependence of spatial
   patterning. The spatial patterns of stony corals are non-random and
   reflect fundamental life-history characteristics of the taxa, suggesting
   that the reef landscape may, in many cases, have important elements of
   spatial predictability.},

Title = {Fine-scale spatial patterns of parrotfish herbivory are shaped by
   resource availability},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {577},
Pages = {165-176},
Month = {AUG 18},
Abstract = {Herbivory by fishes and sea urchins is a powerful mechanism on coral
   reefs that mitigates coral-algal competition by physically removing
   algae and creating bare space. Spatially constrained grazing by
   herbivores, particularly parrotfishes, may foster coral recruitment by
   creating a spatially continuous refuge of bare substrate for settlement
   and survival. However, frequent bouts of concentrated feeding
   potentially remove newly settled corals. Understanding the frequency and
   intensity of parrotfish foraging behavior at appropriate scales (months
   and meters) is essential for connecting herbivory with benthic
   processes. We documented the foraging behavior of a large, mobile coral
   reef herbivore (the steephead parrotfish Chlorurus microrhinos) on
   Palmyra Atoll using various techniques (observational follows, fish
   surveys, and bite scar tracking) across 2 habitat states (one dominated
   by algal turfs, one dominated by live coral and crustose coralline
   algae) that are representative of reefs throughout the Central Pacific.
   Large differences in the abundance of a preferred resource were
   associated with major differences in feeding behavior. Where resources
   were abundant and regrew quickly, foraging areas were small and
   spatially focused, resulting in dense patches of bite scars (> 100 bites
   m(-2)). Feeding behavior also showed a temporal periodicity, with
   individuals defending and regrazing the same area after regrowth
   occurred. In areas where resources were less abundant and recovered more
   slowly, parrotfish movements and foraging areas were significantly
   larger and bites were distributed sparsely across food patches. The
   large variability we observed within a single atoll suggests that
   characterizing species-specific foraging patterns from small-scale
   studies may not be appropriate.},

Month = {AUG 18},
Abstract = {Herbivorous fishes are being increasingly valued for their ecological
   function in coral reef systems, and consequently they have become the
   focus of management actions on many reefs around the world. Because many
   conservation actions require an understanding of the space use patterns
   of species of interest, there has been an increased effort in recent
   years to study the movement patterns and home range sizes of many
   herbivorous taxa. Also of great interest are the fine-scale foraging
   patterns of parrotfishes and the spatial and temporal scale of their
   interactions with benthic organisms. In this study, we performed a
   comprehensive evaluation of the movement patterns of the parrotfish
   Chlorurus microrhinos at multiple spatial and temporal scales at Palmyra
   Atoll in 2013-2015. We found that these fish have large home ranges when
   accounting for migrations to spawning and night refuge sites, but that
   within feeding territories, their activity is highly non-random and is
   quite spatially constrained and temporally episodic, indicating a high
   level of feeding selectivity. These patterns of foraging activity result
   in the patchy removal of algae from the reef, which may have
   consequences for the space competition between algae and corals.},

Abstract = {Spur and groove (SAG) formations are found on the forereefs of many
   coral reefs worldwide. Modeling results have shown that SAG formations
   together with shoaling waves induce a nearshore Lagrangian circulation
   pattern of counter-rotating circulation cells, but these have never been
   observed in the field. We present results from two separate field
   studies of SAG formations on Palmyra Atoll which show their effect on
   waves to be small, but reveal a persistent order 1 cm/s depth-averaged
   Lagrangian offshore flow over the spur and onshore flow over the
   grooves. This circulation was stronger for larger, directly incident
   waves and low alongshore flow conditions, consistent with predictions
   from modeling. Favorable forcing conditions must be maintained on the
   order of 1 h to accelerate and develop the SAG circulation cells. The
   primary cross and alongshore depth-averaged momentum balances were
   between the pressure gradient, radiation stress gradient, and nonlinear
   convective terms, and the bottom drag was similar to values found on
   other reefs. The vertical structure of these circulation cells was
   previously unknown and the results show a complex horizontal offshore
   Lagrangian flow over the spurs near the surface driven by alongshore
   variability in radiation stress gradients. Vertical flow was downward
   over the spur and upward over the groove, likely driven by alongshore
   differences in bottom stress and not by vortex forcing.},

Title = {Ecology and Conservation of Marine Turtles in a Central Pacific Foraging
   Ground},

Abstract = {Foraging grounds are critical to the survival of marine turtles, yet
   studies of these areas lag behind those of nesting sites. Our study
   represents the first data and discussion on marine turtle distribution,
   abundance, and health at a marine turtle foraging ground in the central
   Pacific, Palmyra Atoll National Wildlife Refuge, which constitutes a
   regionally important mixed-size-class foraging ground for green turtles
   (Chelonia mydas) and, to a lesser extent, for hawksbill turtles
   (Eretmochelys imbricata). Surveys and anecdotal reports suggest that
   nesting activity is rare, and we have confirmed the presence of limited
   suitable nesting habitat. During in-water activities from 2008 to 2011,
   we caught 211 green turtles ranging from postpelagic juveniles to adults
   (weight: mean = 44.6 kg, range = 7.2-146.3 kg; curved carapace length
   (CCL): mean = 69.7 cm, range = 41.0-113.6 cm) and 2 juvenile hawksbills
   (weight(2009) = 16.3 kg, CCL2009 = 57.0; weight(2011) = 11.2 kg, CCL2011
   = 50.5 cm). Body condition indices did not significantly differ by year
   of capture. These indices, along with the absence of observed
   fibropapilloma tumors, indicated that turtles at Palmyra Atoll were on
   average in very good condition. We also conducted 11 relative abundance
   surveys from 2005 to 2011, a subset of which revealed an uneven
   distribution of turtles around Palmyra Atoll with 3 hot spots of turtle
   abundance off the flats to the north, south, and east. By linking
   several aspects of our research program with similar efforts at foraging
   grounds throughout the Pacific Basin, we can further our understanding
   of poorly known regional migratory connectivity.},

Title = {Benthic communities at two remote Pacific coral reefs: effects of reef
   habitat, depth, and wave energy gradients on spatial patterns},
Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {1},
Month = {MAY 28},
Abstract = {Kingman Reef and Palmyra Atoll in the central Pacific are among the most
   remote coral reefs on the planet. Here we describe spatial patterns in
   their benthic communities across reef habitats and depths, and consider
   these in the context of oceanographic gradients. Benthic communities at
   both locations were dominated by calcifying organisms (54-86\% cover),
   namely hard corals (20-74\%) and crustose coralline algae (CCA)
   (10-36\%). While turf algae were relatively common at both locations
   (8-22\%), larger fleshy macroalgae were virtually absent at Kingman
   (<1\%) and rare at Palmyra (0.7-9.3\%). Hard coral cover was higher, but
   with low diversity, in more sheltered habitats such as Palmyra's
   backreef and Kingman's patch reefs. Almost exclusive dominance by
   slow-growing Porites on Kingman's patch reefs provides indirect evidence
   of competitive exclusion, probably late in a successional sequence. In
   contrast, the more exposed forereef habitats at both Kingman and Palmyra
   had higher coral diversity and were characterized by fast-growing corals
   (e. g., Acropora and Pocillopora), indicative of more dynamic
   environments. In general at both locations, soft coral cover increased
   with depth, likely reflecting increasingly efficient heterotrophic
   abilities. CCA and fleshy macroalgae cover decreased with depth, likely
   due to reduced light. Cover of other calcified macroalgae, predominantly
   Halimeda, increased with depth. This likely reflects the ability of many
   calcifying macroalgae to efficiently harvest light at deeper depths, in
   combination with an increased nutrient supply from upwelling promoting
   growth. At Palmyra, patterns of hard coral cover with depth were
   inconsistent, but cover peaked at mid-depths at Kingman. On Kingman's
   forereef, benthic community composition was strongly related to wave
   energy, with hard coral cover decreasing and becoming more spatially
   clustered with increased wave energy, likely as a result of physical
   damage leading to patches of coral in localized shelter. In contrast,
   the cover of turf algae at Kingman was positively related to wave
   energy, reflecting their ability to rapidly colonize newly available
   space. No significant patterns with wave energy were observed on
   Palmyra's forereef, suggesting that a more detailed model is required to
   study biophysical coupling there. Kingman, Palmyra, and other remote
   oceanic reefs provide interesting case studies to explore biophysical
   influences on benthic ecology and dynamics.},

Abstract = {Large predators are often highly mobile and can traverse and use
   multiple habitats. We know surprisingly little about how predator
   mobility determines important processes of ecosystem connectivity. Here
   we used a variety of data sources drawn from Palmyra Atoll, a remote
   tropical marine ecosystem where large predators remain in high
   abundance, to investigate how these animals foster connectivity. Our
   results indicate that three of Palmyra's most abundant large predators
   (e.g., two reef sharks and one snapper) use resources from different
   habitats creating important linkages across ecosystems. Observations of
   cross-system foraging such as this have important implications for the
   understanding of ecosystem functioning, the management of large-predator
   populations, and the design of conservation measures intended to protect
   whole ecosystems. In the face of widespread declines of large, mobile
   predators, it is important that resource managers, policy makers, and
   ecologists work to understand how these predators create connectivity
   and to determine the impact that their depletions may be having on the
   integrity of these linkages.},

Title = {Invasive rat eradication strongly impacts plant recruitment on a
   tropical atoll},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {13},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL 17},
Abstract = {Rat eradication has become a common conservation intervention in island
   ecosystems and its effectiveness in protecting native vertebrates is
   increasingly well documented. Yet, the impacts of rat eradication on
   plant communities remain poorly understood. Here we compare native and
   non-native tree and palm seedling abundance before and after eradication
   of invasive rats (Rattus rattus) from Palmyra Atoll, Line Islands,
   Central Pacific Ocean. Overall, seedling recruitment increased for five
   of the six native trees species examined. While pre-eradication
   monitoring found no seedlings of Pisonia grandis, a dominant tree
   species that is important throughout the Pacific region,
   post-eradication monitoring documented a notable recruitment event
   immediately following eradication, with up to 688 individual P. grandis
   seedlings per 100m(2) recorded one month post-eradication. Two other
   locally rare native trees with no observed recruitment in
   pre-eradication surveys had recruitment post-rat eradication. However,
   we also found, by five years post-eradication, a 13-fold increase in
   recruitment of the naturalized and range-expanding coconut palm Cocos
   nucifera. Our results emphasize the strong effects that a rat
   eradication can have on tree recruitment with expected long-term effects
   on canopy composition. Rat eradication released non-native C. nucifera,
   likely with long-term implications for community composition,
   potentially necessitating future management interventions. Eradication,
   nevertheless, greatly benefitted recruitment of native tree species. If
   this pattern persists overtime, we expect long-term benefits for flora
   and fauna dependent on these native species.},

   and Hyachelia lowryi Serejo and Sittrop, 2009, were collected from
   Pacific green turtles, Chelonia mydas (Linnaeus). Given the increased
   awareness of epibionts and the desire of researchers to make positive
   identifications, figures of the diagnostic features of both amphipod
   species are presented. The significance of the cooccurrence of these two

Abstract = {Annual samples from two Palmyra Atoll corals (Porites lutea) that lived
   during the past 110 years were analyzed for radiocarbon (Delta C-14) and
   delta O-18. The Delta C-14 values decreased 7.6 parts per thousand from
   1896 to 1953, similar to other coral records from the tropical and
   subtropical Pacific. Delta C-14 values rose from similar to-60 parts per
   thousand to similar to+110 parts per thousand by 1980 due to the input
   of bomb radiocarbon from the atmosphere. Elevated Delta C-14 values were
   observed for the mid-to late-1950s, suggesting early input of bomb
   radiocarbon, possibly from the largest Marshall Islands bomb tests in
   1954. Secondary aragonite precipitation was identified in a portion of
   one core using scanning electron microscopy and X-radiography, and was
   responsible for high delta O-18 and delta C-13 values and a correlation
   between them. The Delta C-14 results were more resistant to alteration,
   except when contamination was from the bomb era (>1956). (C) 2011

Title = {Evolved Diversification of a Modular Natural Product Pathway: Apratoxins
   F and G, Two Cytotoxic Cyclic Depsipeptides from a Palmyra Collection of
   Lyngbya bouillonii},

Abstract = {A collection of Lyngbya bouillonii from Palmyra Atoll in the Central
   Pacific, a site several thousand kilometers distant from all previous
   collections of this chemically prolific species of cyanobacterium, was
   found to contain two new cancer cell cytotoxins of the apratoxin family.
   The structures of the new compounds, apratoxins F and G, were determined
   by 1D and 2D NMR techniques in combination with mass spectrometric
   methods. Stereochemistry was explored by using chromatographic analyses
   of the hydrolytically released fragments in combination with NMR and
   optical rotation comparisons with known members of the apratoxin family.
   Apratoxins F and G add fresh insights into the SAR of this family
   because they incorporate an N-methyl alanine residue at a position where
   all prior apratoxins have possessed a proline unit, yet they retain high
   potency as cytotoxins to H-460 cancer cells with IC50 values of 2 and 14
   nM, respectively. Additional assays using zone inhibition of cancer
   cells and clonogenic cells give a comparison of the activities of
   apratoxin F to apratoxin A. Additionally, the clonogenic studies in
   combination with maximum tolerated dose (MTD) studies provided insights
   as to dosing schedules that should be used for in vivo studies, and
   preliminary in vivo evaluation validated the predicted in vivo efficacy
   for apratoxin A. These new apratoxins are illustrative of a mechanism
   (the modification of an NRPS adenylation domain specificity pocket) for
   evolving a biosynthetic pathway so as to diversify the suite of
   expressed secondary metabolites.},

Abstract = {As part of a study on holothurians from the southern Gulf of Mexico,
   some Holothuria mexicana Ludwig, 1875 were obtained for gut analysis. In
   two of them, a couple of eulimids were located inside the main tube of
   the respiratory tree. They were identified as Megadenus holothuricola
   Rosen, 1910, described from the Bahamas Islands, based on five specimens
   attached to the respiratory tree of H. mexicana. The original
   description was brief with few details, the type material is lost, and
   the species has not been found again. In this contribution, this species
   is confirmed for Campeche Bay, Mexico. The adult shell is globular to
   conical, transparent, thin, and fragile. Megadenus smithi sp. nov. from
   Palmyra Atoll, Central Pacific is described based on adult specimens. It
   differs from its congeneric species in its more robust shell, the
   pseudopallium does not cover the shell, and its short and contracted
   proboscis forms a thick disc. Further research on these eulimid
   parasites is now complicated in the southern Gulf of Mexico because of
   the holothurian population collapse due to over-exploitation of the
   fishery.},

Abstract = {The main traits of the rich equatorial vegetation covering the remote
   coral atoll Palmyra in North Pacific Ocean, where groves of Cocos
   nucifera L. (Arecaceae) currently dominate on other formations, are here
   summoned. Way and timing of human activities in historical and more
   recent times, which possibly altered the original vegetation, are also
   briefly reviewed.The unusually large size of Palmyra coconut fruits had
   astonished the American botanist Joseph Francis Rock (1884-1962) who
   sent four fruits to the renowned Florentine palm specialist Odoardo
   Beccari (1843-1920). Beccari described the material and validly
   published it in 1916 as Cocos nucifera f. palmyrensis Becc. Part of the
   original material was retrieved at FI. One of the two coconut fruits
   still kept at FI is here designated as lectotype of the Beccari name,
   which is here elevated to the rank of variety, reflecting better than
   form current concepts for isolated island populations. Palmyra Atoll
   with its coconuts played a part in the age-old dispute on the
   geographical origin of Cocos nucifera. This taxon was cited by Beccari
   and by Emilio Chiovenda (1871-1941) as a support to their hypotheses of
   an Asian origin of the species. The significance of these dated
   interpretations in the light of currently available information is here
   briefly discussed.},

Abstract = {The duognathous haemadipsid leeches of the genus Chtonobdella show a
   trans-oceanic distribution throughout the Indo-Pacific region. Although
   passive long-distance dispersal (LDD) of Chtonobdella leeches by birds
   has been suggested, little is known about the host-parasite
   relationships between avian hosts and Chtonobdella leeches. In the
   current study, we investigated Chtonobdella leech infestations of the
   eyes and other mucus membranes of migratory procellariiform seabirds,
   Pterodroma hypoleuca and Oceanodroma tristrami, captured at six
   locations in the Bonin Islands, Honshu and Okinawa Island, Japan.
   Analyses of the partial sequences of 18S rRNA, 28S rRNA, and
   mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) and morphological
   examination of the specimens demonstrated that the Chtonobdella leeches
   belonged to Chtonobdella palmyrae, which is indigenous to Palmyra Atoll
   in the Northern Line Islands. A dominant COI sequence type was observed
   in samples from all six sites; therefore, C. palmyrae almost surely
   dispersed approximately 1000 km by infesting the eyes and mucus
   membranes of procellariiform seabirds. The host-parasite relationships
   between procellariiform seabirds and C. palmyrae provide explicit
   evidence of the LDD of duognathous haemadipsid leeches. The taxonomic
   status of Haemadipsa zeylanica ivosimae from the Volcano Islands is also
   briefly discussed.},

Abstract = {Characterizations of colony-specific fate are necessary to predict
   trajectories of coral population change accurately, and a research
   challenge exists to collect more robust data describing coral
   demographic rates and the factors that influence them. Colonial,
   reef-building corals present challenges to the study of demography,
   given that the size of individual colonies can be decoupled from age,
   and rates of colony growth and shrinkage can be effectively
   indeterminate. In this study, we use a large-area imaging approach to
   quantify demographic rates of the coral genus Pocillopora and test for
   the influence of colony-specific predictors on net change in live tissue
   area (labeled growth and shrinkage) and whole-colony mortality. We found
   that a colony's fate was linked to its initial size, with larger
   colonies experiencing far lower probability of mortality, but higher
   probability of shrinkage, than smaller colonies. Historical effects also
   significantly affected colony fate, as colonies with a recent history of
   tissue loss experienced a higher probability of subsequent shrinkage and
   mortality the following year. Finally, significant variability in growth
   and mortality rates was linked to intra-island site differences, which
   we hypothesize may be driven by differences in food availability and
   heterotrophic feeding rates. Our work highlights the importance of
   colony-specific characteristics, including size and historical effects,
   in influencing demographic fates of corals.},

Title = {Limited trophic partitioning among sympatric delphinids off a tropical
   oceanic atoll},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {12},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG 2},
Abstract = {Understanding trophic relationships among marine predators in remote
   environments is challenging, but it is critical to understand community
   structure and dynamics. In this study, we used stable isotope analysis
   of skin biopsies to compare the isotopic, and thus, trophic niches of
   three sympatric delphinids in the waters surrounding Palmyra Atoll, in
   the Central Tropical Pacific: the melon-headed whale (Peponocephala
   electra), Gray's spinner dolphin (Stenella longirostris longirostris),
   and the common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus). delta N-15
   values suggested that T. truncatus occupied a significantly higher
   trophic position than the other two species. delta C-13 values did not
   significantly differ between the three delphinds, potentially indicating
   no spatial partitioning in depth or distance from shore in foraging
   among species. The dietary niche area-determined by isotopic variance
   among individuals-of T. truncatus was also over 30\% smaller than those
   of the other species taken at the same place, indicating higher
   population specialization or lower interindividual variation. For P.
   electra only, there was some support for intraspecific variation in
   foraging ecology across years, highlighting the need for temporal
   information in studying dietary niche. Cumulatively, isotopic evidence
   revealed surprisingly little evidence for trophic niche partitioning in
   the delphinid community of Palmyra Atoll compared to other studies.
   However, resource partitioning may happen via other behavioral
   mechanisms, or prey abundance or availability may be adequate to allow
   these three species to coexist without any such partitioning. It is also
   possible that isotopic signatures are inadequate to detect trophic
   partitioning in this environment, possibly because isotopes of prey are
   highly variable or insufficiently resolved to allow for differentiation.},

Title = {Porites superfusa mortality and recovery from a bleaching event at
   Palmyra Atoll USA},
Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {5},
Month = {MAY 2},
Abstract = {Background. The demography of a coral colony is not a binary trajectory
   of life and death. Based on the flexibility afforded by colonial
   organization, most reef-building corals employ a variety of dynamic
   survival strategies, including growth and shrinkage. The demographic
   flexibility affects coral size, shape and reproductive output, among
   other factors. It is thus critical to quantify the relative importance
   of key dynamics of recruitment, mortality, growth and shrinkage in
   changing the overall cover of coral on a reef.
   Methods. Using fixed photographic quadrats, we tracked the patterns of
   change in the cover of one common central Pacific coral, Porites
   superfusa, before and after the 2009 ENSO event.
   Results. Coral colonies suffered both whole and partial colony
   mortality, although larger colonies were more likely to survive. In
   subsequent years, recruitment of new colonies and regrowth of surviving
   colonies both contributed to the modest recovery of P. superfusa.
   Discussion. This study is unique in its quantitative comparisons of
   coral recruitment versus regrowth during periods of areal expansion. Our
   data suggest that recovery is not limited simply to the long pathway of
   settlement, recruitment and early growth of new colonies but is
   accelerated by means of regrowth of already established colonies having
   suffered partial mortality.},

Title = {Distant Storms as Drivers of Environmental Change at Pacific Atolls},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 31},
Abstract = {The central Pacific Ocean with its many low lying islands and atolls is
   under threat from sea level rise and increased storm activity. Here, we
   illustrate how increasing frequency and severity of large scale storm
   events associated with global climate change may be particularly
   profound at the local scale for human populations that rely on lagoon
   systems for provision of a variety of goods and services. In August 2011
   a storm originating in the Southern Ocean caused a large amplitude ocean
   swell to move northward through the Pacific Ocean. Its arrival at
   Palmyra Atoll coincided with transient elevated sea surface height and
   triggered turnover of the lagoon water column. This storm-induced change
   to the lagoon reflects long distance connectivity with propagated wave
   energy from the Southern Ocean and illustrates the increasing threats
   generated by climate change that are faced by human populations on most
   low-lying Pacific islands and atolls.},

Title = {Microbial Ecology of Four Coral Atolls in the Northern Line Islands},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {3},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB 27},
Abstract = {Microbes are key players in both healthy and degraded coral reefs. A
   combination of metagenomics, microscopy, culturing, and water chemistry
   were used to characterize microbial communities on four coral atolls in
   the Northern Line Islands, central Pacific. Kingman, a small uninhabited
   atoll which lies most northerly in the chain, had microbial and water
   chemistry characteristic of an open ocean ecosystem. On this atoll the
   microbial community was equally divided between autotrophs (mostly
   Prochlorococcus spp.) and heterotrophs. In contrast, Kiritimati, a large
   and populated (similar to 5500 people) atoll, which is most southerly in
   the chain, had microbial and water chemistry characteristic of a
   near-shore environment. On Kiritimati, there were 10 times more
   microbial cells and virus-like particles in the water column and these
   microbes were dominated by heterotrophs, including a large percentage of
   potential pathogens. Culturable Vibrios were common only on Kiritimati.
   The benthic community on Kiritimati had the highest prevalence of coral
   disease and lowest coral cover. The middle atolls, Palmyra and
   Tabuaeran, had intermediate densities of microbes and viruses and higher
   percentages of autotrophic microbes than either Kingman or Kiritimati.
   The differences in microbial communities across atolls could reflect
   variation in 1) oceaonographic and/or hydrographic conditions or 2)
   human impacts associated with land-use and fishing. The fact that
   historically Kingman and Kiritimati did not differ strongly in their
   fish or benthic communities (both had large numbers of sharks and high
   coral cover) suggest an anthropogenic component in the differences in
   the microbial communities. Kingman is one of the world's most pristine
   coral reefs, and this dataset should serve as a baseline for future
   studies of coral reef microbes. Obtaining the microbial data set, from
   atolls is particularly important given the association of microbes in
   the ongoing degradation of coral reef ecosystems worldwide.},

   atolls in the northern Line Islands, central Pacific},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {365},
Pages = {199-215},
Abstract = {We describe the abundance, biomass, size composition, and trophic
   structure of fish assemblages of shallow (10 m depth) fore reef habitats
   at 2 US Pacific atolls (Kingman, Palmyra) and 2 Kiribati-owned atolls
   (Tabuaeran, Kiritimati) in the northern Line Islands. Our
   characterization spans several coincident gradients (in human habitation
   and exploitation, latitude, and nutrient upwelling) from uninhabited,
   presently unfished, and oligotrophic Kingman to relatively densely
   populated, fished, and equatorially upwelled Kiritimati. Major findings
   are most consistent with direct effects of extraction on large-bodied
   predators and indirect effects on lower-level assemblage structure. Fish
   assemblages at Palmyra and especially Kingman atolls were characterized
   by high total standing biomass, large average body sizes, a
   preponderance of apex predators and other piscivorous fishes in an
   inverted biomass pyramid, few and small planktivorous fishes, and
   herbivores dominated by non-territorial species. Median body sizes at
   color change from initial to terminal phase (an index of sex change in
   parrotfishes) were also small for 4 species of parrotfish at Kingman and
   Palmyra. Fish assemblages at Tabuaeran and especially Kiritimati atolls
   had starkly contrasting characteristics: piscivorous and other
   fisheries-targeted fishes were depauperate, lower-trophic levels
   dominated fish biomass, planktivorous fishes were targer-bodied and more
   numerous, territorial herbivores were better represented, and size at
   maturation in parrotfishes was proportionately larger. Our results show
   the effects that even modest fishing effort can have on assemblage
   structure and indicate the importance of reefs like Kingman as
   increasingly rare relicts of natural coral reefs, providing insights
   into the natural structure and function of these ecosystems.},

Year = {2020},

Abstract = {Accurate estimation of central tropical Pacific (CTP) climate
   variability on interannual to centennial time scales is required for
   robust projections of future global climate trends. Here we outline an
   approach that blends instrumental and coral proxy observations to yield
   a continuous, monthly resolved record of climate evolution in the CTP
   spanning the past 160 years. We concatenate coral oxygen isotope (delta
   O-18) records from multiple living and fossil corals collected from
   Fanning Island (4 degrees N, 160 degrees W) and Palmyra Island (5
   degrees N; 162 degrees W) located in the heart of the El Nino-Southern
   Oscillation. We use the regularized expectation maximization (RegEM)
   method to impute missing data across short gaps of 5 to 23 years within
   and beyond individual coral records. The resulting monthly resolved
   Fanning/Palmyra Island climate record spans continuously from 1863 to
   2016 and provides an example of how extended time series can be built
   from shorter coral segments. The extended record highlights the strong
   trend toward warmer and wetter mean conditions in late twentieth
   century, in agreement with the majority of climate model hindcast
   simulations. The continuous reconstruction also enables a direct
   comparison of four exceptionally strong El Nino events (1877-1878,
   1940-1941, 1997-1998, and 2015-2016). Three of these very strong El Nino
   events in the CTP featured a precursor warm event in the prior year and
   that may have favored the development of a strong El Nino event.},

Volume = {199},

Pages = {387-396},

Abstract = {For many organisms, early life stages experience significantly higher
   rates of mortality relative to adults. However, tracking early life
   stage individuals through time in natural settings is difficult,
   limiting our understanding of the duration of these `mortality
   bottlenecks', and the time required for survivorship to match that of
   adults. Here, we track a cohort of juvenile corals (1-5 cm maximum
   diameter) from 12 taxa at a remote atoll in the Central Pacific from
   2013 to 2017 and describe patterns of annual survivorship. Of the 537
   juveniles initially detected, 219 (41\%) were alive 4 years later, 163
   (30\%) died via complete loss of live tissue from the skeleton, and the
   remaining 155 (29\%) died via dislodgement. The differing mortality
   patterns suggest that habitat characteristics, as well as
   species-specific features, may influence early life stage survival.
   Across most taxa, survival fit a logistic model, reaching > 90\% annual
   survival within 4 years. These data suggest that mortality bottlenecks
   characteristic of `recruitment' extend up to 5 years after individuals
   can be visually detected. Ultimately, replenishment of adult coral
   populations via sexual reproduction is needed to maintain both coral
   cover and genetic diversity. This study provides key insights into the
   dynamics and time scales that characterize these critical early life
   stages.},

Abstract = {Biological invasions are a pervasive and dominant form of anthropogenic
   disturbance. However, we seldom have the opportunity to evaluate the
   long-term, indirect, and often slow-moving cascading effects of
   invasions at the community and ecosystem scale. Here we synthesize the
   collective knowledge from 10 years of study on the influence of the deep
   historical introduction of coconut palms (Cocos nucifera L.) across a
   series of islets at Palmyra Atoll. Through a suite of pathways, we find
   this palm drives near-complete ecosystem state change when it becomes
   dominant. Abiotic conditions are transformed, with major soil nutrients
   2.7-11.5 times lower and water stress 15\% elevated in palm- dominated
   forests compared with native forest. Faunal communities are likewise
   dramatically altered, not only in composition but also in behavior, body
   size, and body condition. Biotic interactions, including herbivory
   rates, palatability, and seed predation, are likewise changed.
   Cumulatively, these changes transform food webs, leading to dramatically
   shortened and simplified food chains in invaded ecosystems. Many of
   these changes appear to create slow- acting feedback loops that favor
   the palm at the expense of native species. Given the widespread nature
   of this historical introduction, many island and coastal regions of
   tropical oceans may be similarly transformed.},

Title = {Area-restricted searching by manta rays and their response to spatial
   scale in lagoon habitats},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {456},
Pages = {233-244},
Abstract = {Animals may use a variety of search patterns to locate resources when
   the exact locations of those resources are unknown. Theoretical and
   empirical evidence suggests that the optimal type of random walk will
   vary based on the distribution of resources such as prey. Once resources
   are located, the animal may utilize a movement strategy that allows it
   to remain within a small area and maximize resource acquisition
   (area-restricted searching, ARS). Detecting the location of ARS zones is
   important, as it identifies profitable habitat to the animal, although
   such analysis is rarely conducted with fishes. We utilized correlated
   random walk (CRW), fractal, and first passage time (FPT) analysis to
   quantify the response of planktivorous manta rays Manta alfredi to
   spatial scale and identify locations of ARS within lagoons at Palmyra
   Atoll. Mantas used CRWs at small spatial scales to move between prey
   patches, but not at larger scales as they performed home-ranging
   behavior. One domain was located with straighter movements at scales
   <330 m, and more tortuous movements at scales >330 m. ARS was located
   adjacent to ledges with high abundance of plankton, or within channels.
   Fractal and FPT analyses suggest that mantas used patches that were 5 to
   49\% of the scale of their activity space over short time periods
   (days). Quantitative analytical tools help explain observed patterns of
   movements and demonstrate the importance of lagoon habitats to these
   macro-planktivores.},

Journal = {CORAL REEFS},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {26},

Pages = {47-51},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {On coral reefs in Palmyra-a central Pacific atoll with limited fishing
   pressure-total fish biomass was 428 and 299\% greater than on reefs in
   nearby Christmas and Fanning Islands. Large apex predators, groupers,
   sharks, snappers, and jacks larger than 50 cm in length, accounted for
   56\% of total fish biomass in Palmyra on average, but only 7 and 3\% on
   Christmas and Fanning. These biomass proportions are remarkably similar
   to those previously reported for the remote and uninhabited Northwest
   Hawaiian Islands (NWHI) and densely populated Main Hawaiian Islands
   (MHI), although Palmyra's reefs are dominated in biomass by sharks (44\%
   of the total), whereas the NWHI by jacks (39\%). Herbivorous fish
   biomass was also greater on Palmyra than on Christmas and Fanning (343
   and 207\%, respectively). These results and previous findings indicate
   that remote, uninhabited islands support high levels of consumers, and
   highlight the importance of healthy coral reef ecosystems as reference
   points for assessment of human impacts and establishment of restoration
   goals.},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Many different drivers, including productivity, ecosystem size, and
   disturbance, have been considered to explain natural variation in the
   length of food chains. Much remains unknown about the role of these
   various drivers in determining food chain length, and particularly about
   the mechanisms by which they may operate in terrestrial ecosystems,
   which have quite different ecological constraints than aquatic
   environments, where most food chain length studies have been thus far
   conducted. In this study, we tested the relative importance of ecosystem
   size and productivity in influencing food chain length in a terrestrial
   setting. We determined that (1) there is no effect of ecosystem size or
   productive space on food chain length; (2) rather, food chain length
   increases strongly and linearly with productivity; and (3) the observed
   changes in food chain length are likely achieved through a combination
   of changes in predator size, predator behavior, and consumer diversity
   along gradients in productivity. These results lend new insight into the
   mechanisms by which productivity can drive changes in food chain length,
   point to potential for systematic differences in the drivers of food web
   structure between terrestrial and aquatic systems, and challenge us to
   consider how ecological context may control the drivers that shape food
   chain length.},

Title = {Shoaling behavior of coral reef fishes varies between two islands with
   different predator abundance},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {690},
Pages = {133-145},
Month = {JUN 2},
Abstract = {Human-induced environmental change has affected ecosystems on a global
   scale, altering the ecology and evolutionary trajectories of various
   species. Fishing of marine predators, and any cascading effects on
   marine ecosystems, is of critical concern. Predators are thought to be
   an important reason for why fish shoal; thus, reducing predator
   populations could alter shoaling behavior for prey fish, and impact
   aspects of their behavior or life-histories. Here, we explore
   differences in shoaling behavior of coral reef fishes at 2 islands whose
   predator populations face differing fishing intensities. We compared the
   tendency to shoal for 3 fish species between 2 Pacific coral reefs:
   Palmyra Atoll (USA), an unfished reef with high predator abundance, and
   Moorea (French Polynesia), a fished reef with low predator abundance. We
   also specifically characterize movement and foraging-associated
   behaviors of one of these fishes, the convict surgeonfish Acanthurus
   triostegus, in this same comparative context. Our work suggests that in
   areas with reduced predator abundance, the tendency of some, but not
   all, fish species to form shoals is reduced. Decreased predator
   abundance also appears to have affected movement of shoaling and
   solitary A. triostegus, with increases in distance travelled and area
   covered occurring in contexts with low predator abundance. These
   observations shed some empirical light on how overfishing could affect
   shoaling behavior. Such insight is specifically valuable in the context
   of coral reefs, where changes to low-trophic level fish movement and
   foraging (2 behaviors closely linked with shoaling) could affect the
   functioning of these vulnerable ecosystems.},

Title = {Evaluation of MPA designs that protect highly mobile megafauna now and
   under climate change scenarios},
Journal = {GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {35},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Marine protected area (MPA) designs, including large-scale MPAs (LSMPAs;
   > 150,000 km2), mobile MPAs (fluid spatiotemporal boundaries), and MPA
   networks, may offer different benefits to species and could enhance
   protection by encompassing spatiotemporal scales of animal movement. We
   sought to understand how well LSMPAs could benefit nine highly-mobile
   marine species in the tropics now and into the future by: 1) evaluating
   current range overlap within a LSMPA; 2) evaluating range overlap under
   climate change projections; and 3) evaluating how well theoretical MPA
   designs benefit these nine species. We focused on Palmyra Atoll and
   Kingman Reef, a 2000 km(2) area within the 1.2 million km(2) U.S.
   Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument (PRIMNM) that contains
   marine megafauna (reef and pelagic fishes; sea turtles; seabirds;
   cetaceans) reflecting different behaviors and habitat use. Our approach
   is useful for evaluating the effectiveness of the Palmyra-Kingman MPA
   and PRIMNM in protecting these species, and tropical LSMPAs in general,
   and for informing future MPA design. Stationary MPAs provided protection
   at varying scales. Reef manta rays (Mobula alfredi), grey reef sharks
   (Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos), green sea turtles (Chelonia mydas), and
   bottlenose dolphins (Tur-siops truncatus) had overall small ranges (<
   100 km from Palmyra-Kingman) and could benefit from stationary MPAs that
   contained heterogenous reef habitats. Yellowfin tuna (Thunnus
   albacares), sooty terns (Onychoprion fuscatus), red-footed boobies (Sula
   sula), great frigatebirds (Fregata minor), and melon-headed whales
   (Peponocephala electra) navigated complex oceanographic processes and
   may benefit most from mobile MPAs that shift with features including
   thermal fronts, cyclic regions of elevated productivity, and eddies, if
   relationships with these features are established and predictable. All
   species had capacity to travel to nearby reef systems, illustrating
   potential benefits of MPA networks and protected corridors. Suitable
   habitats will likely contract for all species as warm water expands
   under climate change scenarios (species habitats were predicted to
   decrease by 4-49\% at Palmyra-Kingman) and MPAs may not protect suitable
   habitats into the future. Species habitat requirements and movement
   ecologies are critical aspects of marine spatial planning, especially
   with respect to dynamic ocean processes and a changing climate.},

   predator population at carrying capacity},
Journal = {ISCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {25},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 21},
Abstract = {Prey depletion may contribute to marine predator declines, yet the
   forage base required to sustain an unfished population of predatory fish
   at carrying capacity is unknown. We integrated demographic and
   physiological data within a Bayesian bioenergetic model to estimate
   annual consumption of a gray reef shark (Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos)
   population at a remote Pacific atoll (Palmyra Atoll) that are at
   carrying capacity. Furthermore, we estimated the proportion of the
   atoll's reef fish biomass production consumed by the gray reef sharks,
   assuming sharks either partially foraged pelagically (mean 7\%), or
   solely within the reef environment (mean 52\%). We then predicted the
   gray reef shark population potential of other, less remote PacificOcean
   coral reef islands, illustrating that current populations are
   substantially smaller than could be supported by their forage base. Our
   research highlights the utility of modeling how far predator population
   sizes are from their expected carrying capacity in informing marine
   conservation.},

Title = {Sea turtles across the North Pacific are exposed to perfluoroalkyl
   substances},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {279},
Month = {JUN 15},
Abstract = {Perfluorinated alkyl substances (PFASs) are global, persistent, and
   toxic contaminants. We assessed PFAS concentrations in green (Chelonia
   mydas) and hawksbill (Eretmochelys imbricata) turtles from the North
   Pacific. Fifteen compounds were quantified via liquid chromatography
   tandem mass spectrometry from 62 green turtle and 6 hawksbill plasma
   samples from Hawai'i, Palmyra Atoll, and the Northern Marianas Islands.
   Plasma from 14 green turtles severely afflicted with
   fibropapillomatosis, and eggs from 12 Hawaiian hawksbill nests from 7
   females were analyzed. Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) predominated in
   green turtle plasma; perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) predominated in
   hawksbill tissues. Concentrations were greater in hawksbill than green
   turtle plasma (p < 0.05), related to trophic differences. Green turtle
   plasma PFOS concentrations were related to human populations from
   highest to lowest: Hawai'i, Marianas, Palmyra. Influence on
   fibropapillomatosis was not evident. PFASs were maternally transferred
   to hawksbill eggs, with decreasing concentrations with distance from
   airports and with clutch order from one female. A risk assessment of
   PFOS showed concern for immunosuppression in Kailua green turtles and
   alarming concern for hawksbill developmental toxicity.
   Perfluoroundecanoic (PFUnA) and perfluorotridecanoic (PFTriA) acid
   levels were correlated with reduced emergence success (p < 0.05).
   Studies to further examine PFAS effects on sea turtle development would
   be beneficial.

Title = {Tutuilamides A-C: Vinyl-Chloride-Containing Cyclodepsipeptides from
   Marine Cyanobacteria with Potent Elastase Inhibitory Properties},
Journal = {ACS CHEMICAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {15},
Number = {3},
Pages = {751-757},
Month = {MAR 20},
Abstract = {Marine cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) have been shown to possess an
   enormous capacity to produce structurally diverse natural products that
   exhibit a broad spectrum of potent biological activities, including
   cytotoxic, antifungal, antiparasitic, antiviral, and antibacterial
   activities. Using mass-spectrometryguided fractionation together with
   molecular networking, cyanobacterial field collections from American
   Samoa and Palmyra Atoll yielded three new cyclic peptides, tutuilamides
   A-C. Their structures were established by spectroscopic techniques
   including 1D and 2D NMR, HR-MS, and chemical derivatization. Structure
   elucidation was facilitated by employing advanced NMR techniques
   including nonuniform sampling in combination with the 1,1-ADEQUATE
   experiment. These cyclic peptides are characterized by the presence of
   several unusual residues including 3-amino-6-hydroxy-2-piperidone and
   2-amino-2-butenoic acid, together with a novel vinyl chloride-containing
   residue. Tutuilamides A-C show potent elastase inhibitory activity
   together with moderate potency in H-460 lung cancer cell cytotoxicity
   assays. The binding mode to elastase was analyzed by X-ray
   crystallography revealing a reversible binding mode similar to the
   natural product lyngbyastatin 7. The presence of an additional hydrogen
   bond with the amino acid backbone of the flexible side chain of
   tutuilamide A, compared to lyngbyastatin 7, facilitates its
   stabilization in the elastase binding pocket and possibly explains its
   enhanced inhibitory potency.},

Title = {Tropical seabirds sample broadscale patterns of marine contaminants},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {691},
Pages = {631-643},
Month = {NOV 15},
Abstract = {Contaminants in the marine environment are widespread, but ship-based
   sampling routines are much narrower. We evaluated the utility of
   seabirds, highly-mobile marine predators, as broad samplers of
   contaminants throughout three tropical ocean regions. Our aim was to
   fill a knowledge gap in the distributions of, and processes that
   contribute to, tropical marine contaminants; and explore how
   species-specific foraging ecologies could inform or bias our
   understanding of contaminant distributions. Mercury and persistent
   organic pollutant (POPs) concentrations were measured in adults of five
   seabird species from four colonies in the central Pacific (Laysan and
   Tern Islands, Hawaii; Palmyra Atoll) and the eastern Caribbean
   (Barbuda). Blood-based total mercury (THg) and 89 POPs were measured in
   two seabird families: surface-foraging frigatebirds (Fregata spp.) and
   plunge-diving boobies (Sula spp.). Overall, largescale contaminant
   differences between colonies were more informative of contaminant
   distributions than inter-specific foraging ecology. Model selection
   results indicated that proximity to human populations was the best
   predictor of THg and POPs. Regional differences in contaminants were
   distinct: Barbudan Magnificent Frigatebirds had more compounds (n =
   52/89 POP detected) and higher concentrations (geometric mean THg = 0.97
   mu g g(-1); mean Sigma POP53 = 26.6 ng mL(-1)) than the remote colonies
   (34-42/89 POP detected; range of THg geometric means = 0.33-0.93 mu g
   g(-1); range of mean Sigma POP53:7.3-17.0 ng mL(-1)) and had the most
   recently-synthesized POPs. Moderate differences in foraging ecologies
   were somewhat informative of inter-specific differences in contaminant
   types and concentrations between nearshore and offshore foragers. Across
   species, contaminant concentrations were higher in frigatebirds (THg =
   0.87 mu g g(-1); Sigma POP53 = 17.5 ng mL(-1)) compared to boobies (THg
   = 0.48 mu g g(-1); Sigma POP53=9.8). Ocean currents and contaminants'
   physiochemical properties provided additional insight into the scales of
   spatial and temporal contaminant exposure. Seabirds are excellent, broad
   samplers with which we can understand contaminant distributions in the
   marine environment. This is especially important for tropical remote
   regions that are under-sampled. (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {No persistent behavioural effects of SCUBA diving on reef sharks},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {567},
Pages = {173-184},
Month = {MAR 13},
Abstract = {Despite rapid growth in the marine tourism sector, the impacts of
   recreation on the marine environment are generally not well understood.
   Most existing studies of marine recreation ecology have focused on
   behavioural changes resulting from direct interactions between humans
   and wildlife including provisioning. However, non-consumptive,
   non-provisioning human impacts may also result in persistent behavioural
   impacts to shark populations. In this study, we examined differences in
   residency, abundance, and behaviour of reef sharks at Palmyra Atoll in
   response to long-term SCUBA diving activity, using a combination of
   survey techniques including baited remote underwater video systems and
   multi-year passive acoustic monitoring. In most locations with
   recreational diving operations, some level of human impact is pervasive,
   but on Palmyra, extractive fishing is prohibited, and scientific diving
   activities are concentrated on just a few sites that house long-term
   monitoring projects. These sites experience relatively intensive diving,
   while the majority of the island is entirely undived. Evidence from
   elsewhere has shown that sharks behaviourally respond to people in the
   water over short time scales, but our results indicate that this
   response may not persist. We did not detect differences in reef shark
   abundance or behaviour between heavily dived and undived locations, nor
   were there differences in shark residency patterns at dived and undived
   sites in a year with substantial diving activity and a year without any
   diving. Our results suggest that humans can interact with reef sharks
   without persistent behavioural impacts, and that well-regulated shark
   diving tourism can be accomplished without undermining conservation
   goals.},

Title = {Assessing the effectiveness of a large marine protected area for reef
   shark conservation},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {207},
Pages = {64-71},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Large marine protected areas (MPAs) have recently been established
   throughout the world at an unprecedented pace, yet the value of these
   reserves for mobile species conservation remains unclear. Reef shark
   populations continue to decline even within some of the largest MPAs,
   fueling unresolved debates over the ability of protected areas to aid
   mobile species that transit beyond MPA boundaries. We assessed the
   capacity of a large MPA to conserve grey reef sharks - a Near Threatened
   species with a widespread distribution and poorly understood offshore
   movement patterns - using a combination of conventional tags, satellite
   tags, and an emerging vessel tracking technology. We found that the
   54,000 km(2) U.S. Palmyra Atoll National Wildlife Refuge in the central
   Pacific Ocean provides substantial protection for grey reef sharks, as
   two-thirds of satellite-tracked sharks remained within MPA boundaries
   for the entire study duration. Additionally, our analysis of >0.5
   million satellite detections of commercial fishing Vessels identified
   virtually no fishing effort within the refuge and significant effort
   beyond the MPA perimeter, suggesting that large MPAs can effectively
   benefit reef sharks and other mobile species if properly enforced.
   However, our results also highlight limitations of place-based
   conservation as some of these reef-associated sharks moved surprising
   distances into pelagic waters (up to 926 km from Palmyra Atoll, 810 km
   beyond MPA boundaries). Small-scale fishermen operating beyond MPA
   boundaries (up to 366 km from Palmyra) captured 2\% of sharks that were
   initially tagged at Palmyra, indicating that large MPAs provide
   substantial, though incomplete, protection for reef sharks. (C) 2017

Title = {Resetting predator baselines in coral reef ecosystems},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {7},
Pages = {1-9},
Month = {FEB 21},
Abstract = {What did coral reef ecosystems look like before human impacts became
   pervasive? Early efforts to reconstruct baselines resulted in the
   controversial suggestion that pristine coral reefs have inverted trophic
   pyramids, with disproportionally large top predator biomass. The
   validity of the coral reef inverted trophic pyramid has been questioned,
   but until now, was not resolved empirically. We use data from an
   eight-year tag-recapture program with spatially explicit,
   capture-recapture models to re-examine the population size and density
   of a key top predator at Palmyra atoll, the same location that inspired
   the idea of inverted trophic biomass pyramids in coral reef ecosystems.
   Given that animal movement is suspected to have significantly biased
   early biomass estimates of highly mobile top predators, we focused our
   reassessment on the most mobile and most abundant predator at Palmyra,
   the grey reef shark (Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos). We estimated a density
   of 21.3 (95\% CI 17.8, 24.7) grey reef sharks/km(2), which is an order
   of magnitude lower than the estimates that suggested an inverted trophic
   pyramid. Our results indicate that the trophic structure of an
   unexploited reef fish community is not inverted, and that even healthy
   top predator populations may be considerably smaller, and more
   precarious, than previously thought.},

Abstract = {Thermal stress increases the incidence of coral disease, which is
   predicted to become more common with climate change, even on pristine
   reefs such as those surrounding Palmyra Atoll in the Northern Line
   Islands that experience minimal anthropogenic stress. Here we describe a
   strain of Vibrio coralliilyticus, OCN014, which was isolated from
   Acropora cytherea during an outbreak of Acropora white syndrome (AWS), a
   tissue loss disease that infected 25\% of the A. cytherea population at
   Palmyra Atoll in 2009. OCN014 recreated signs of disease in
   experimentally infected corals in a temperature-dependent manner. Genes
   in OCN014 with expression levels positively correlated with temperature
   were identified using a transposon-mediated genetic screen. Mutant
   strains harbouring transposon insertions in two such genes, toxR (a
   toxin regulator) and mshA (the 11th gene of the 16-gene
   mannose-sensitive hemagglutinin (MSHA) type IV pilus operon), had
   reduced infectivity of A. cytherea. Deletion of toxR and the MSHA operon
   in a second strain of V. coralliilyticus, OCN008, that induces acute
   Montipora white syndrome in a temperature-independent manner had
   similarly reduced virulence. This work provides a link between
   temperature-dependent expression of virulence factors in a pathogen and
   infection of its coral host.},

Abstract = {Coral reefs are threatened worldwide, and there is a need to develop new
   approaches to monitor reef health under natural conditions. Because
   simultaneous measurements of net community production (NCP) and net
   community calcification (NCC) are used as important indicators of reef
   health, tools are needed to assess them in situ. Here we present the
   Benthic Ecosystem and Acidification Measurement System (BEAMS) to
   provide the first fully autonomous approach capable of sustained,
   simultaneous measurements of reef NCP and NCC under undisturbed, natural
   conditions on time scales ranging from tens of minutes to weeks. BEAMS
   combines the chemical and velocity gradient in the benthic boundary
   layer to quantify flux from the benthos for a variety of parameters to
   measure NCP and NCC. Here BEAMS was used to measure these rates from two
   different sites with different benthic communities on the western reef
   terrace at Palmyra Atoll for 2 weeks in September 2014. Measurements
   were made every similar to 15 min. The trends in metabolic rates were
   consistent with the benthic communities between the two sites with one
   dominated by fleshy organisms and the other dominated by calcifiers
   (degraded and healthy reefs, respectively). This demonstrates the
   potential utility of BEAMS as a reef health monitoring tool. NCP and NCC
   were tightly coupled on time scales of minutes to days, and light was
   the primary driver for the variability of daily integrated metabolic
   rates. No correlation between CO2 levels and daily integrated NCC was
   observed, indicating that NCC at these sites were not significantly
   affected by CO2.},

   morphologically by size, pore shape, pore density, and the relative size
   of the apical pore complex. The ITS1/5.8S/ITS2 and the D1/D2 regions of
   the LSU rDNA were used to provide molecular support of morphological
   observations using maximum likelihood and Bayesian analyses.
   Furthermore, C. palmyrensis and C. santacroce both showed cytotoxic

   dissipation in terms of the root-mean-square velocity cubed, we find
   that the wave friction factor, f(w), for this reef is 1.800.07, nearly
   an order of magnitude larger than values previously found for reefs. We
   attribute this remarkably high value of f(w) to the complex canopy
   structure of the reef, which we believe may be characteristic of healthy
   reefs. This suggests that healthy reefs with high coral cover may
   provide greater coastal protection than do degraded reefs with low coral
   cover.},

Title = {Stable isotopes in barnacles as a tool to understand green sea turtle

Journal = {BIOGEOSCIENCES},

Volume = {12},

Abstract = {Sea turtles are migratory animals that travel long distances between
   their feeding and breeding grounds. Traditional methods for researching
   sea turtle migratory behavior have important disadvantages, and the
   development of alternatives would enhance our ability to monitor and
   manage these globally endangered species. Here we report on the isotope
   signatures in green sea-turtle (Chelonia mydas) barnacles (Platylepas
   sp.) and discuss their potential relevance as tools with which to study
   green sea turtle migration and habitat use patterns. We analyzed oxygen
   (delta O-18) and carbon (delta C-13) isotope ratios in barnacle calcite
   layers from specimens collected from green turtles captured at the
   Palmyra Atoll National Wildlife Refuge (PANWR) in the central Pacific.
   Carbon isotopes were not informative in this study. However, the oxygen
   isotope results suggest likely regional movement patterns when mapped
   onto a predictive oxygen isotope map of the Pacific. Barnacle proxies
   could therefore complement other methods in understanding regional
   movement patterns, informing more effective conservation policy that
   takes into account connectivity between populations.},

Title = {Umbrella species in marine systems: using the endangered humphead wrasse
   to conserve coral reefs},
Journal = {ENDANGERED SPECIES RESEARCH},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {27},
Number = {3},
Pages = {251-263},
Abstract = {Extinction risk is closely tied to body size, home range, and species
   distribution. Quantifying home range is critical for conservation, and
   can enable the use of concepts such as `umbrella species', whose
   conservation protects other species due to shared habitat. To determine
   the value of the humphead wrasse as an umbrella species for coral reef
   conservation, we conducted a multi-year study of humphead wrasse home
   range at Palmyra Atoll, Central Tropical Pacific, tagging juvenile,
   female, and male individuals with acoustic transmitters. We quantified
   home range using 2 metrics, length and area, and determined if these
   metrics were related to the sex and maturity status of the individual.
   We recorded individual movements during 5030 fish days, yielding
   detailed records for 14 individuals comprising 3 juveniles, 5 females,
   and 6 males. The home range of humphead wrasse measured over a 2 yr
   study was 0.4 to 14 km and changed with ontogeny. Females had larger
   home ranges than other reef fishes studied to date (n = 68), indicating
   value as an umbrella species for coral reefs. We compared the home range
   of the species to the size distribution of tropical marine protected
   areas (MPAs), and used a model to estimate the MPA length necessary to
   retain humphead wrasse. Most MPAs are too small to effectively protect
   the humphead wrasse.},

Title = {Resurrection of Mesoplodon hotaula Deraniyagala 1963: A new species of

Abstract = {We present genetic and morphological evidence supporting the recognition
   of a previously synonymized species of Mesoplodon beaked whale in the
   tropical Indo-Pacific, Mesoplodon hotaula. Although the new species is
   closely-related to the rare ginkgo-toothed beaked whale M. ginkgodens,
   we show that these two lineages can be differentiated by maternally
   (mitochondrial DNA), biparentally (autosomal), and paternally (Y
   chromosome) inherited DNA sequences, as well as by morphological
   features. The reciprocal monophyly of the mtDNA genealogies and the
   largely parapatric distribution of these lineages is consistent with
   reproductive isolation. The new lineage is currently known from at least
   seven specimens: Sri Lanka (1), Gilbert Islands, Republic of Kiribati
   (1+), Palmyra Atoll, Northern Line Islands, U. S. A. (3), Maldives (1),
   and Seychelles (1). The type specimen (Sri Lanka) was described as a new
   species, M. hotaula, in 1963, but later synonymized with M. ginkgodens.
   This discovery brings the total number of Mesoplodon species to 15,
   making it, by far, the most speciose yet least known genus of cetaceans.},

Title = {Crebradomus and Dissimularia, new genera in the family Chondrymeniaceae
   (Gigartinales, Rhodophyta) from the central, southern and western
   Pacific Ocean},
Journal = {PHYCOLOGIA},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {53},
Number = {2},
Pages = {146-166},
Abstract = {Two new genera of tropical-/subtropical-Pacific macroalgae are proposed.
   The monotypic Crebradomus gen. nov., based on C. gongylocarpus sp. nov.,
   is restricted to Lord Howe Island in the southern Australasian-Pacific
   Ocean. Dissimularia gen. nov. consists of the type species, D.
   dactylocarpa sp. nov., from its Lord Howe Island type locality, as well
   as from the Hawaiian Islands, Guam and possibly Burma and the southern
   Great Barrier Reef, plus three geographically restricted, virtually
   cryptic species from small islands or atolls in Samoa and Micronesia.
   The long-problematical `Cryptonemia? umbraticola' is shown on the basis
   of molecular studies of recent collections from its type locality,
   remote Palmyra Atoll, to represent a distinct species of Dissimularia,
   D. umbraticola comb. nov., with D. tauensis sp. nov. and D. withallii
   sp. nov. from Tau and Jarvis Islands, respectively, also belonging to
   this complex. Morphological features common to these taxa included
   turf-like, often imbricate thin blades of irregular contour, thalli that
   tended to occupy shaded habitats on coral reefs between 1.5- and 40-m
   depths, and blade sections that consisted of a shallow anticlinal cortex
   and a broad, lax to densely compact medulla of mostly periclinal
   filaments interspersed with varying numbers of anticlinally and
   obliquely traversing filaments. Only Crebredomus was found cystocarpic,
   the carposporophytes densely aggregated in verrucose marginal pods and
   consisting of a lengthy narrow fusion cell of irregular contours and a
   candelabra-shaped distal cluster of gonimoblast filaments bearing
   terminal chains of two or three carposporangia beneath a narrow ostiole.
   Male gametophytes and tetrasporophytes remain unknown in both genera.
   Molecular data indicated the generic distinctness of Crebradomus and
   Dissimularia, as well as the whole complex as members of the recently
   designated family Chondrymeniaceae of the order Gigartinales.},

Title = {Wide distributional range of marine sponges along the Pacific Ocean},
Journal = {MARINE BIOLOGY RESEARCH},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {9},
Number = {8},
Pages = {768-775},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {Widespread geographic distribution of sponges should be rare, mainly
   because of the low dispersal capacity of their larvae and asexual
   products. Here we investigate the potential wide-scale distribution
   range in one marine sponge, Gelliodes wilsoni, that has been spread
   widely around the Pacific Rim by shipping. The species was originally
   described from the Philippines (western Pacific Ocean) by Wilson in 1925
   as Gelliodes fibrosa. Recently, similar specimens have been collected
   from Guam (western Pacific Ocean), Hawaii, Palmyra Atoll (central
   Pacific Ocean), Acapulco Bay and Baja Peninsula (eastern Pacific Ocean).
   This species now appears to be widely distributed across the Pacific
   Ocean, and this distribution seems unlikely to have resulted from an
   extremely high dispersal capability; it is most likely the result of
   centuries of trans-Pacific shipping. We also propose the new name G.
   wilsoni for the species G. fibrosa originally described by Wilson
   because the same name was previously used by Dendy in 1905 to describe a
   species from Sri Lanka, which is morphologically different from the
   species described by Wilson. The case of G. wilsoni is not unique
   because several sponges (discussed here) have similar distribution
   patterns across the Pacific (at locations more than 10,000 km apart).
   This suggests an eastwest connectivity and that widespread distribution
   in sponges is indeed possible, albeit the result of human activities. In
   an increasingly connected world our research highlights the importance
   of understanding connectivity across oceanic scales in order to predict
   where invasive species are likely to occur.},

Abstract = {Observation network data comprise animal presences detected by observer
   stations at fixed spatial locations. Statistical analysis of these data
   is complicated by spatial bias in sampling and temporal variability in
   detection conditions. Advanced methods for analysis of these data are
   required but are currently underdeveloped. We propose a state-space
   model (SSM) for observation network data to estimate detailed movements
   of individual animals. The underlying movement model is an
   Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process, which is stationary, and therefore has
   an inherent mechanism that models home range behaviour. An integral part
   of the approach is the detection function, which models the probability
   of logging animal presences. The detection function is also used to
   provide absence information when animals are undetected. Since the
   ability to detect an animal often depends on time-varying external
   factors such as environmental conditions, we use covariate information
   about detection efficiency as control variables. Via simulation, we
   found that movement estimation error scales log-linearly with network
   sparsity. This result can be used to indicate the number of stations
   necessary to achieve a desired upper bound on estimation error.
   Furthermore, we found that the SSM outperforms existing techniques in
   terms of estimating detailed movements and that estimates are robust
   towards mis-specification of the detection function. We also tested the
   importance of accounting for time-varying detection conditions and found
   that the probability of making wrong conclusions decreases substantially
   when covariate information is exploited. The model is used to estimate
   movements and home range of a humphead wrasse (Cheilinus undulatus) at
   Palmyra Atoll in the central Pacific Ocean. Here, detection conditions
   have a strong diel component, which is controlled for using detection
   efficiency information from a reference device. The presented approach
   enhances the toolbox for analysis of observation network data as
   collected by acoustic telemetry or potentially other aspiring methods
   such as camera trapping and mobile phone tagging. By explicitly
   modelling movement and observation processes, the model integrates all
   sources of uncertainty and provides a sound statistical basis for making
   well-informed management decisions from imperfect information.},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Remote areas harbor some of the world's most undisturbed ecosystems.
   Major conservation gains can be made by effectively protecting nature in
   these remote zones. Conducting conservation work in remote settings
   presents both unique challenges and promising opportunities. We discuss
   how five commonly used approaches for conservation (buy and protect
   conservation; conservation motivated by the intrinsic values of nature;
   ecosystem service based conservation; ecotourism driven conservation;
   and conservation enabled by community planning) can be optimally applied
   to protect ecosystems in these special settings. In this discussion we
   draw examples from two model remote sites: Palmyra and Tabuaeran Atolls.
   Spatial analyses conducted using population density as a proxy for
   remoteness indicate that many existing recognized protected areas
   already include remote regions, but that the vast majority of the
   overall remote zones on the planet are not yet formally protected.
   Initiating discussions that directly consider both the roadblocks and
   opportunities for conservation in remote areas will help increase our
   odds of successfully protecting biodiversity in these unique and
   strategically important contexts. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Bacterial strains CNX-216(T) and CNU-914(T) were isolated from marine
   sediment samples collected from Palmyra Atoll and off Catalina Island,
   respectively. Both strains were Gram-negative and aerobic and produce
   deep-orange to pink colonies and alkaloid secondary metabolites. Cells
   of strain CNX-216(T) were short, non-motile rods, whereas cells of
   strain CNU-914(T) were short, curved rods with gliding motility. The DNA
   G + C contents of CNX-216(T) and CNU-914(T) were respectively 57.7 and
   44.4 mol\%. Strains CNX-216(T) and CNU-914(T) contained MK-7 as the
   predominant menaquinone and iso-C-15:0 and C-(16:1)omega 5c as the major
   fatty acids. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that both strains belong to
   the order Cytophagales in the phylum Bacteroicletes. Strain CNX-216(T)
   exhibited low 16S rRNA gene sequence identity (87.1 \%) to the nearest
   type strain, Cesiribacter roseus 311(T), and formed a well-supported
   lineage that is outside all currently described families in the order
   Cytophagales. Strain CNU-914(T) shared 97.6\% 16S rRNA gene sequence
   identity with `Porifericola rhodea' N5EA6-3A2B and, together with
   `Tunicatimonas pelagia' N5DB8-4 and four uncharacterized marine bacteria
   isolated as part of this study, formed a lineage that is clearly
   distinguished from other families in the order Cytophagales. Based on
   our polyphasic taxonomic characterization, we propose that strains
   CNX-216(T) and CNU-914(T) represent novel genera and species, for which
   we propose the names Mooreia alkaloidigena gen. nov., sp. nov. (type
   strain CNX-216(T) =DSM 25187(T) =KCCM 90102(T)) and Catalinimonas
   alkaloidigena gen. nov., sp. nov. (type strain CNU-914(T) =DSM 25186(T)
   =KCCM 90101(T)) within the new families Mooreiaceae fam. nov. and

Title = {Species-specific consequences of ocean acidification for the calcareous
   tropical green algae Halimeda},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {440},
Pages = {67-78},
Abstract = {Ocean acidification (OA), resulting from increasing dissolved carbon
   dioxide (CO2) in surface waters, is likely to affect many marine
   organisms, particularly those that calcify. Recent OA studies have
   demonstrated negative and/or differential effects of reduced pH on
   growth, development, calcification and physiology, but most of these
   have focused on taxa other than calcareous benthic macroalgae. Here we
   investigate the potential effects of OA on one of the most common coral
   reef macroalgal genera, Halimeda. Species of Halimeda produce a large
   proportion of the sand in the tropics and are a major contributor to
   framework development on reefs because of their rapid calcium carbonate
   production and high turnover rates. On Palmyra Atoll in the central
   Pacific, we conducted a manipulative bubbling experiment to investigate
   the potential effects of OA on growth, calcification and photophysiology
   of 2 species of Halimeda. Our results suggest that Halimeda is highly
   susceptible to reduced pH and aragonite saturation state but the
   magnitude of these effects is species specific. H. opuntia suffered net
   dissolution and 15\% reduction in photosynthetic capacity, while H.
   taenicola did not calcify but did not alter photophysiology in
   experimental treatments. The disparate responses of these species to
   elevated CO2 partial pressure (pCO(2)) may be due to anatomical and
   physiological differences and could represent a shift in their relative
   dominance in the face of OA. The ability for a species to exert
   biological control over calcification and the species specific role of
   the carbonate skeleton may have important implications for the potential
   effects of OA on ecological function in the future.},

Abstract = {Large animals are severely depleted in many ecosystems, yet we are only
   beginning to understand the ecological implications of their loss. To
   empirically measure the short-term effects of removing large animals
   from an ocean ecosystem, we used exclosures to remove large fish from a
   near-pristine coral reef at Palmyra Atoll, Central Pacific Ocean. We
   identified a range of effects that followed from the removal of these
   large fish. These effects were revealed within weeks of their removal.
   Removing large fish (1) altered the behavior of prey fish; (2) reduced
   rates of herbivory on certain species of reef algae; (3) had both direct
   positive (reduced mortality of coral recruits) and indirect negative
   (through reduced grazing pressure on competitive algae) impacts on
   recruiting corals; and (4) tended to decrease abundances of small mobile
   benthic invertebrates. Results of this kind help advance our
   understanding of the ecological importance of large animals in
   ecosystems.},

Abstract = {Spectral parameters were used to discriminate between echolocation
   clicks produced by three dolphin species at Palmyra Atoll: melon-headed
   whales (Peponocephala electra), bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops runcatus)
   and Gray's spinner dolphins (Stenella longirostris longirostris). Single
   species acoustic behavior during daytime observations was recorded with
   a towed hydrophone array sampling at 192 and 480 kHz. Additionally, an
   autonomous, bottom moored High-frequency Acoustic Recording Package
   (HARP) collected acoustic data with a sampling rate of 200 kHz.
   Melon-headed whale echolocation clicks had the lowest peak and center
   frequencies, spinner dolphins had the highest frequencies and bottlenose
   dolphins were nested in between these two species. Frequency differences
   were significant. Temporal parameters were not well suited for
   classification. Feature differences were enhanced by reducing
   variability within a set of single clicks by calculating mean spectra
   for groups of clicks. Median peak frequencies of averaged clicks (group
   size 50) of melon-headed whales ranged between 24.4 and 29.7 kHz, of
   bottlenose dolphins between 26.7 and 36.7 kHz, and of spinner dolphins
   between 33.8 and 36.0 kHz. Discriminant function analysis showed the
   ability to correctly discriminate between 93\% of melon-headed whales,
   75\% of spinner dolphins and 54\% of bottlenose dolphins. (C) 2010

Title = {Resource partitioning by species but not sex in sympatric boobies in the
   central Pacific Ocean},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {403},
Pages = {291-301},
Abstract = {Sympatric species with similar ecological requirements and differences
   in body size would be expected to partition resources to facilitate
   coexistence. For sexually dimorphic species, we may expect resource
   partitioning by gender as well as by species identity. However, it is
   difficult to document species and sexual resource partitioning in marine
   ecosystems, given the intractability of these systems and the vagility
   of many marine animals. Here, we examined differences in the foraging
   behavior and prey selection of 2 congeneric and coexisting seabird
   species-masked boobies Sula dactylatra and red-footed boobies Sula
   sula-on Palmyra Atoll in the equatorial Pacific Ocean. These seabirds
   exhibit substantial size dimorphism between species and also have
   reverse sexual dimorphism within species. Pronounced interspecific
   differences in foraging patterns were observed with high-resolution GPS
   tracking devices, where smaller red-footed boobies conducted longer
   foraging trips (in both time and distance). Red-footed boobies also had
   more frequent landings on the sea surface, slower mean and maximum
   travel speeds, and more westerly trip azimuths. Stable isotope and diet
   analyses produced data that complemented returns from electronic
   tagging. Stable isotope ratios of carbon indicated that masked boobies
   foraged on prey with a less pelagic delta C-13 signature compared to
   red-fooled boobies. In contrast, no gender differences were identified
   in any foraging parameters. The mechanisms for maintenance of these
   pronounced differences in niche partitioning across species were not
   explicitly examined, yet the data suggest physiological variation across
   species may be a more plausible mechanism than competitive interactions.},

   AREAS},

Volume = {84},
Number = {2},
Pages = {211-227},

Abstract = {During 2006 and 2007, the first comprehensive, quantitative coral
   disease assessment was conducted at seven coral islands and atolls in
   the central Pacific: Johnston, Palmyra, Kingman, and Wake Atolls, and
   Howland, Baker, and Jarvis Islands. Collectively, they are referred to
   as Pacific Remote Island Areas (PRIA), spanning over 4000 km and nearly
   20 degrees latitude. Distribution and prevalence of disease were
   determined from 25-m belt transects at 80 sites, covering an area of
   over 22,000 m(2) of reef habitat. Six broad disease categories were
   recognized affecting 12 different scleractinian genera; prevalence was
   computed based on the estimated total number of coral colonies per
   survey site. The most geographically and taxonomically widespread
   disease was skeletal growth anomalies detected at nearly 40\% of sites
   and on six different anthozoan genera. In contrast, the most prevalent
   disease was acute tissue loss (or white syndrome) which was hosted by
   four scleractinian genera, including Acropora, Montipora, Goniastrea,
   and Platygyra. Pigmentation response and other sublethal lesions, such
   as algal and cyanophyte infections, and tube-worm infestations, were
   infrequent and occurred in low prevalences. The overall abundance of
   coral diseases in the U.S. PRIA was low; however, patterns of prevalence
   varied among coral genera and indicated a few taxa were
   disproportionately affected by disease, namely the Acroporidae and
   Poritidae. Of potential concern is white syndrome, which results in
   severe and rapid tissue loss, particularly on the tabular Acropora
   cytherea (Dana, 1846) at Johnston Atoll.},

Title = {Distributions of stress-resistant coral symbionts match environmental
   patterns at local but not regional scales},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {378},
Pages = {93-103},
Abstract = {Distribution patterns of stress-tolerant coral symbionts suggest that
   maximum habitat temperatures can drive local scale adaptation of
   symbiont populations, but at regional scales other processes can
   dominate. We assayed clade membership for symbionts of 2 closely related
   corals from American Samoa, Fiji, the Philippines and Palmyra Atoll.
   Temperature stress-tolerant Clade D symbionts occur more frequently in
   American Samoa (83\%) than in Palmyra, Fiji or the Philippines (< 1\%).
   In American Samoa, Clade D symbionts dominate habitats with higher
   maximum temperatures, while Clades C and D are both common under lower
   maximum temperatures. While corals in American Samoa show more
   stress-tolerant symbionts, this region does not exhibit higher sea
   surface temperatures, a greater record of heating anomalies or more
   bleaching than the other 3 regions. That these local patterns do not
   hold regionally suggests the importance of other factors, including host
   responses, other environmental correlates, within-clade physiological
   diversity and dispersal limitation, in driving the distribution of coral
   symbionts.},

Abstract = {Corals are dependent upon lipids as energy reserves to mount a metabolic
   response to biotic and abiotic challenges. This study profiled lipids,
   fatty acids, and microbial communities of healthy and white syndrome
   (WS) diseased colonies of Acropora hyacinthus sampled from reefs in
   Western Australia, the Great Barrier Reef, and Palmyra Atoll. Total
   lipid levels varied significantly among locations, though a consistent
   stepwise decrease from healthy tissues from healthy colonies (HH) to
   healthy tissue on WS-diseased colonies (HD; i.e. preceding the lesion
   boundary) to diseased tissue on diseased colonies (DD; i.e. lesion
   front) was observed, demonstrating a reduction in energy reserves.
   Lipids in HH tissues were comprised of high energy lipid classes, while
   HD and DD tissues contained greater proportions of structural lipids.
   Bacterial profiling through 16S rRNA gene sequencing and histology
   showed no bacterial taxa linked to WS causation. However, the relative
   abundance of Rhodobacteraceae-affiliated sequences increased in DD
   tissues, suggesting opportunistic proliferation of these taxa. While the
   cause of WS remains inconclusive, this study demonstrates that the lipid
   profiles of HD tissues was more similar to DD tissues than to HH
   tissues, reflecting a colony-wide systemic effect and provides insight
   into the metabolic immune response of WS-infected Indo-Pacific corals.},

Title = {Insights into coral reef benthic dynamics from nonlinear spatial
   forecasting},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY INTERFACE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {16},
Number = {153},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Nonlinear time-series forecasting, or empirical dynamic modelling, has
   been used extensively in the past two decades as a tool for
   distinguishing between random temporal behaviour and nonlinear
   deterministic dynamics. Previous authors have extended nonlinear
   time-series forecasting to continuous spatial data. Here, we adjust
   spatial forecasting to handle discrete data and apply the technique to
   explore the ubiquity of nonlinear determinism in irregular spatial
   configurations of coral and algal taxa from Palmyra Atoll, a relatively
   pristine reef in the central Pacific Ocean. We find that the spatial
   distributions of coral and algal taxa show signs of nonlinear
   determinism in some locations and that these signals can change through
   time. We introduce the hypothesis that nonlinear spatial determinism may
   be a signal of systems in intermediate developmental (i.e. successional)
   stages, with spatial randomness characterizing early (i.e. recruitment
   dominated) and late-successional (i.e. `climax' or attractor) phases.
   Common state-based metrics that sum community response to environmental
   forcing lack resolution to detect dynamics of (potential) recovery
   phases; incorporating signal of spatial patterning among sessile taxa
   holds unique promise to elucidate dynamical characters of complex
   ecological systems, thereby enhancing study and response efforts.},

Abstract = {Native forests on islands throughout the global tropics face increasing
   pressure from the human-driven expansion of coconut palm (Cocos
   nucifera) planted for the purposes of coconut oil harvest. Conversion
   from native forests to Cocos monocultures leads to drastic ecological
   consequences in island environments and alters terrestrial and marine
   food webs through a variety of cascading effects and feedbacks. Despite
   the ecological significance and geographic range of Cocos expansion,
   large-scale assessments of coconut proliferation are still lacking due
   to the isolated nature of many islands where Cocos is found. Remote
   sensing approaches are often used to monitor forest composition at broad
   scales, but the small physical size of most islands limits the use of
   many popular satellite sensors with 15-30 m resolution. The recent
   availability of very high resolution (<5 m) satellite imagery
   facilitates novel assessment of this major ecological pattern, but the
   increased resolution introduces problematic `salt-and-pepper' effects
   due to the heterogeneous nature of palm frond canopies. This case study
   evaluates the effectiveness of applying grey-level co-occurrence matrix
   (GLCM) textural features to very high resolution (0.5-2 m) WorldView-2
   imagery to resolve the canopy heterogeneity problem and map the extent
   of Cocos spread on 21 islets of Palmyra Atoll, a protected United States
   National Wildlife Refuge in the Northern Line Islands. A random forest
   (RF)-driven classification scheme differentiating between coconut palms,
   native trees including Pisonia grandis, and endemic Scaevola sericea
   shrubs achieved 97.0\% overall accuracy and 98.4\% producer's and user's
   accuracies for the coconut palm class when trained on a combined
   spectral and GLCM textural feature set. Classifications restricted to
   the eight spectral bands of WorldView-2 are not only less accurate
   (89.4\% overall accuracy), but also significantly worse at identifying
   Cocos canopies (79.0\% versus 98.0\% accuracy when GLCM textures are
   included). However, paring down the full set of sixteen spectral and
   textural features to the three most important of each type did not
   result in significant changes in accuracy. These results demonstrate the
   effectiveness of a joint high-resolution textural and spectral approach
   for remotely quantifying the spread of Cocos and its impacts on native
   tree communities throughout the tropics, including remote island
   locations.},

Title = {Plasticity of foraging behaviors in response to diverse environmental
   conditions},
Journal = {ECOSPHERE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {9},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Due to rapidly changing global environmental conditions, many animals
   are now experiencing concurrent changes in both resource availability
   and the foraging cues associated with finding those resources. By
   employing flexible, plastic foraging strategies that use different types
   of environmental foraging cues, animals could adapt to these novel
   future environments. To evaluate the extent to which such flexibility
   and plasticity exist, we analyzed a large dataset of a Glade (Sulidae;
   the boobies) of widespread aerial tropical predators that feed in highly
   variable marine habitats. These surface foragers are typical of many
   ocean predators that face dynamic and patchy foraging environments and
   use a combination of static and ephemeral oceanographic features to
   locate prey. We compared foraging habitats and behaviors of four species
   at seven colonies in the eastern and central Pacific Ocean that varied
   greatly in depth, topography, and primary productivity. Foraging
   behaviors, recorded by GPS-tracking tags, were compared to remotely
   sensed environmental features, to characterize habitat-behavior
   interactions. K-means clustering grouped environmental characteristics
   into five habitat clusters across the seven sites. We found that boobies
   relied on a combination of static and ephemeral cues, especially depth,
   chlorophyll-a concentrations, and sea surface height (ocean surface
   topography). Notably, foraging behaviors were strongly predicted by
   local oceanographic habitats across species and sites, suggesting a high
   degree of behavioral plasticity in use of different foraging cues.
   Flexibility allows these top predators to adapt to, and exploit, static
   and ephemeral oceanic features. Plasticity may well facilitate these
   species, and other similarly dynamic foragers, to cope with increasingly
   changing environmental conditions.},

Volume = {60},

Abstract = {A robust marine radiocarbon (C-14) reservoir correction (Delta R) is
   essential for calibrating C-14 dates of marine mollusks and fish bones
   routinely found in archaeological sites as discarded food remains and
   bones of terrestrial animals (including humans) with an appreciable
   marine diet. New Delta R values are reported for the atoll archipelago
   of the Marshall Islands, eastern Micronesia. Atolls consist of
   biogenetic material-mostly coral and foraminifera-that can be directly
   dated for establishing sequences of atoll emergence and islet
   development. After sectioning and examination using scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM) to screen for sample diagenesis, 6 pristine branch
   coral samples were selected from the modern oceanside beach, 3
   archaeological sites, and islet developmental facies from Ebon Atoll (4
   degrees 34'N, 168 degrees 41'E). Each sample was analyzed by U-series
   and accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) C-14 showing no substantial
   temporal Delta R variations and yielding a weighted mean Delta R of 41
   +/- 42 yr(1) spanning similar to 500 yr before earliest human
   colonization (the period when islets first became habitable) through the
   entire 2000-yr occupation sequence. Reliable published Delta R values
   for Micronesia and Delta C-14 data for Palmyra Island, together with our
   results for Ebon Atoll, indicate that the Pacific North Equatorial
   Counter Current is almost stable for the past 2500 yr.},

Abstract = {Shark species play an important role in shaping marine communities,
   ecosystems, and community assemblages, yet their high mobility and low
   abundances in certain locations makes studying the way they interact
   with these systems difficult Here high-resolution acoustic cameras are
   demonstrated as effective tools to study the ecology and behavior of
   reef and coastal sharks that operate in the vicinity of a near-pristine
   coral reef atoll. The acoustic camera generated detailed imagery and
   size measurements from >1000 sightings of sharks that traversed a
   discrete corridor linking two of the atoll's distinct marine habitats,
   the forereef and offshore pelagic habitat with the atoll's lagoon. Daily
   shark density and estimated biomass values varied considerably through
   time, but generally approximated values calculated using less
   comprehensive and more labor-intensive techniques at this same atoll.
   Diel patterns in shark movements revealed elevated shark presence during
   low-light periods of the day (e.g. peak sighting density just after
   dusk), but weaker links between shark movement patterns and tides. Data
   gathered through use of this tool extends and reinforces some of the
   observations made of smaller numbers of sharks using traditional data
   collection methods while providing unique additional insights into the
   ways that larger numbers of sharks operate at fine spatial scales over
   longer periods of time. Behavioral information of this type is critical
   to developing effective management plans for these vulnerable species.

Abstract = {Quantifying the ecological importance of individual habitats to highly
   mobile animals is challenging because patterns of habitat reliance for
   these taxa are complex and difficult to observe. We investigated the
   importance of lagoons to the manta ray, Manta alfredi, a wide-ranging
   and vulnerable species in a less-disturbed atoll ecosystem. Lagoons are
   highly sensitive to anthropogenic disturbance and are known to be
   ecologically important to a wide variety of mobile species. We used a
   novel combination of research tools to examine the reliance of M.
   alfredi on lagoon habitats. Stable isotope analysis was used to assay
   the recent energetic importance of lagoons to M. alfredi;
   high-resolution tracking data provided information about how M. alfredi
   utilised lagoonal habitats over long and short time periods; acoustic
   cameras logged patterns of animal entrances and departures from lagoons;
   and photo identification/laser photogrammetry provided some insight into
   why they may be using this habitat. M. alfredi showed strong evidence of
   energetic dependence on lagoon resources during the course of the study
   and spent long periods of residence within lagoons or frequently
   transited into them from elsewhere. While within lagoons, they
   demonstrated affinities for particular structural features within this
   habitat and showed evidence of temporal patterning in habitat
   utilization. This work sheds light on how and why M. alfredi uses
   lagoons and raises questions about how this use may be altered in
   disturbed settings. More generally, these observations contribute to our
   knowledge of how to assess the ecological importance of particular
   habitats situated within the broader home range of mobile consumers.},

Title = {Benthic processes and overlying fish assemblages drive the composition
   of benthic detritus on a central Pacific coral reef},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {482},
Pages = {181+},
Abstract = {While detrital material is recognized as an important food source on
   coral reefs, its role in reef food webs remains unclear. We quantified
   standing stock and input rates to the detrital resource pool in exposed
   forereef and protected backreef habitats of Palmyra Atoll National
   Wildlife Refuge and measured the trophic structure of the overlying fish
   assemblage. While detrital standing stock was 1.6 times higher on the
   backreef than on the forereef, detrital input rates were 1.7 to 2.9
   times higher on the forereef. Planktivores were the most abundant guild
   in the fore reef habitat, and stable isotope signatures of detritus
   reflected a greater input from pelagic sources (i.e. depleted in (13C)).
   In contrast, herbivores and detritivores numerically dominated the
   backreef habitat and detrital stable isotope signatures appeared to be
   predominately of benthic origin (i.e. enriched in C-13). Through total
   organic carbon (TOC) and nitrogen analyses we found that benthic
   detritus may represent a significant nutritional source. Converting
   total nitrogen into maximum protein estimates, we found high benthic
   deposition of protein (104 to 124 mg m(-2) d(-1)) and organic carbon
   (184 to 190 mg m(-2) d(-1)), but very low standing stocks of these
   materials (protein: 5 to 6 mg m(-2), organic carbon: 46 to 63 mg m(-2)).
   While high water flow rates may explain low standing stocks of detritus
   in forereef habitats, the lower flow rates in backreef habitats suggest
   that removal of this material is via consumption by abundant roving
   detritivorous fishes. Our results provide support for the hypothesis
   that reef fish detritivory represents a significant consumer-mediated
   energy pathway, promoting nutrient recycling by linking many elements of
   a complex food web.},

Abstract = {Southall et al. (2006) concluded that a near mass stranding (MS) of
   melon-headed whales (MHWs), Peponocephala electra, in Hanalei Bay,
   Kauai, Hawaii, on 3-4 July 2004, was likely related to the operation of
   mid-frequency sonars (MFS). However, subsequent authors argued that the
   nearly simultaneous entry of MHWs into Sasanhaya Bay, Rota (similar to
   5,740 km away) made this conclusion untenable. They suggested that both
   sightings, and other MSs of MHWs, could be related to lunar cycles. To
   resolve this question, we reviewed information on the biology and
   behavior of MHWs and compared the two sightings to observations of MHWs
   around Palmyra Atoll and Nuku Hiva, French Polynesia. We also tested for
   a relationship between observations and MSs of MHWs with lunar cycles.
   MHWs near many oceanic islands rest nearshore during the day and feed
   offshore in deeper water at night. The MHWs at Rota exhibited normal
   diurnal resting behavior as seen at Palmyra and Nuku Hiva, while those
   at Kauai showed milling behavior typically seen prior to MS events.
   Thus, these events were not similar. Neither observations nor MSs of
   MHWs were related to lunar cycles. Our review of MHW behavior
   strengthens the case that MFS use played a major role in the near MS in
   Hanalei Bay.},

Title = {Geographically distinct blue whale song variants in the Northeast
   Pacific},
Journal = {ENDANGERED SPECIES RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {46},
Pages = {19-33},
Abstract = {The Northeast Pacific (NEP) population of blue whales Balaenoptera
   musculus musculus is currently managed as a single stock. We
   investigated the fine-scale frequency characteristics of 1 NEP blue
   whale song unit, the B call. We analyzed B calls from passive acoustic
   data collected between 2010 and 2013 at 2 low-latitude sites, Palmyra
   Atoll and the Hawaiian Islands, and 3 higher-latitude sites, off
   southern California, off Washington state and in the Gulf of Alaska.
   Frequency measurements were extracted along the contour of the third
   harmonic from each call, and data from each region were compared. Calls
   from the Gulf of Alaska and Hawai'i presented a downshift in frequency,
   beginning just past the midway point of the contour, which was not
   present in calls recorded from southern California or Palmyra Atoll.
   Calls from Washington displayed intermediate characteristics between
   those from the other 2 high-latitude sites. Cluster analysis resulted in
   consistent grouping of call contours from Washington and southern
   California, in what we termed the NEP B1 variant, while contours from
   Hawai'i and the Gulf of Alaska were grouped together, as a NEP B2
   variant. Frequency differences were also observed among the variants;
   the Gulf of Alaska displayed the highest frequency on average, followed
   by Washington, then southern California. Consistent with other studies,
   a yearly decline in the frequency of B calls was also observed. This
   discovery of at least 2 geographically distinct variants provides the
   first evidence of vocally distinct subpopulations within the NEP,
   indicating the possibility of a need for finer-scale population
   segmentation.},

Title = {Spatial scaling properties of coral reef benthic communities},
Journal = {ECOGRAPHY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {44},
Number = {2},
Pages = {188-198},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The spatial structure of ecological communities on tropical coral reefs
   across seascapes and geographies have historically been poorly
   understood. Here we addressed this for the first time using spatially
   expansive and thematically resolved benthic community data collected
   around five uninhabited central Pacific oceanic islands, spanning 6
   degrees latitude and 17 degrees longitude. Using towed-diver digital
   image surveys over similar to 140 linear km of shallow (8-20 m depth)
   tropical reef, we highlight the autocorrelated nature of coral reef
   seascapes. Benthic functional groups and hard coral morphologies
   displayed significant spatial clustering (positive autocorrelation) up
   to kilometre-scales around all islands, in some instances dominating
   entire sections of coastline. The scale and strength of these
   autocorrelation patterns showed differences across geographies, but
   patterns were more similar between islands in closer proximity and of a
   similar size. For example, crustose coralline algae (CCA) were clustered
   up to scales of 0.3 km at neighbouring Howland and Baker Islands and
   macroalgae were spatially clustered at scales up to similar to 3 km at
   both neighbouring Kingman Reef and Palmyra Atoll. Of all the functional
   groups, macroalgae had the highest levels of spatial clustering across
   geographies at the finest resolution of our data (100 m). There were
   several cases where the upper scale at which benthic community members
   showed evidence of spatial clustering correlated highly with the upper
   scales at which concurrent gradients in physical environmental drivers
   were spatially clustered. These correlations were stronger for surface
   wave energy than subsurface temperature (regardless of benthic group)
   and turf algae and CCA had the closest alignments in scale with wave
   energy across functional groups and geographies. Our findings suggest
   such physical drivers not only limit or promote the abundance of various
   benthic competitors on coral reefs, but also play a key role in
   governing their spatial scaling properties across seascapes.},

   Activity},
Journal = {MOLECULES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {25},
Number = {7},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Marine Cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) have been shown to possess an
   enormous potential to produce structurally diverse natural products that
   exhibit a broad spectrum of potent biological activities, including
   cytotoxic, antifungal, antiparasitic, antiviral, and antibacterial
   activities. Here, we report the isolation and structure determination of
   palstimolide A, a complex polyhydroxy macrolide with a 40-membered ring
   that was isolated from a tropical marine cyanobacterium collected at
   Palmyra Atoll. NMR-guided fractionation in combination with MS2-based
   molecular networking and isolation via HPLC yielded 0.7 mg of the pure
   compound. The small quantity isolated along with the presence of
   significant signal degeneracy in both the H-1 and C-13-NMR spectra
   complicated the structure elucidation of palstimolide A. Various NMR
   experiments and solvent systems were employed, including the LR-HSQMBC
   experiment that allows the detection of long-range H-1-C-13 correlation
   data across 4-, 5-, and even 6-bonds. This expanded NMR data set enabled
   the elucidation of the palstimolide's planar structure, which is
   characterized by several 1,5-disposed hydroxy groups as well as a
   tert-butyl group. The compound showed potent antimalarial activity with
   an IC50 of 223 nM as well as interesting anti-leishmanial activity with
   an IC50 of 4.67 mu M.},

   studies have been conducted to assess the spatial generalization
   principles of a live coral cover classifier trained using remote sensing
   data from multiple locations. The aim of this study is to develop a
   machine learning classifier for coral dominated benthic cover-type class
   (CDBCTC) based on ground truth observations and Landsat images, evaluate
   the performance of this classifier when tested against new data, then
   deploy the classifier to perform CDBCTC change analysis of multiple
   locations. The proposed framework includes image calibration, support
   vector machine (SVM) training and tuning, statistical assessment of
   model accuracy, and temporal pixel-based image differencing. Validation
   of the methodology was performed by cross-validation and train/test
   split using ground truth observations of benthic cover from four
   different reefs. These four locations (Palmyra Atoll, Kingman Reef,
   Baker Island Atoll, and Howland Island) as well as two additional
   locations (Kiritimati Island and Tabuaeran Island) were then evaluated
   for CDBCTC change detection. The in-situ training accuracy against
   ground truth observations for Palmyra Atoll, Kingman Reef, Baker Island
   Atoll, and Howland Island were 87.9\%, 85.7\%, 69.2\%, and 82.1\%
   respectively. The classifier attained generalized accuracy scores of
   78.8\%, 81.0\%, 65.4\%, and 67.9\% for the respective locations when
   trained using ground truth observations from neighboring reefs and
   tested against the local ground truth observations of each reef. The
   classifier was trained using the consolidated ground truth data of all
   four sites and attained a cross-validated accuracy of 75.3\%. The CDBCTC
   change detection analysis showed a decrease in CDBCTC of 32\% at Palmyra
   Atoll, 25\% at Kingman Reef, 40\% at Baker Island Atoll, 25\% at Howland
   Island, 35\% at Tabuaeran Island, and 43\% at Kiritimati Island. This
   research establishes a methodology for developing a robust classifier
   and the associated Controlled Parameter Cross-Validation (CPCV) process
   for evaluating how well the model will generalize to new data. It is an
   important step for improving the scientific understanding of temporal
   change within coral reefs around the globe.},

Abstract = {This study was an evaluation of the spectral signature generalization
   properties of coral across four remote Pacific Ocean reefs. The sites
   under consideration have not been the subject of previous studies for
   coral classification using remote sensing data. Previous research
   regarding using remote sensing to identify reefs has been limited to
   in-situ assessment, with some researchers also performing temporal
   analysis of a selected area of interest. This study expanded the
   previous in-situ analyses by evaluating the ability of a basic
   predictor, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), trained on Depth
   Invariant Indices calculated from the spectral signature of coral in one
   location to generalize to other locations, both within the same scene
   and in other scenes. Three Landsat 8 scenes were selected and masked for
   null, land, and obstructed pixels, and corrections for sun glint and
   atmospheric interference were applied. Depth Invariant Indices (DII)
   were then calculated according to the method of Lyzenga and an LDA
   classifier trained on ground truth data from a single scene. The
   resulting LDA classifier was then applied to other locations and the
   coral classification accuracy evaluated. When applied to ground truth
   data from the Palmyra Atoll location in scene path/row 065/056, the
   initial model achieved an accuracy of 80.3\%. However, when applied to
   ground truth observations from another location within the scene,
   namely, Kingman Reef, it achieved an accuracy of 78.6\%. The model was
   then applied to two additional scenes (Howland Island and Baker Island
   Atoll), which yielded an accuracy of 69.2\% and 71.4\%, respectively.
   Finally, the algorithm was retrained using data gathered from all four
   sites, which produced an overall accuracy of 74.1\%.},

Abstract = {Live coral cover (LCC) is regarded as the most efficient indicator of
   coral reef health. However, LCCs are usually sampled with standardized
   transect or photo quadrat techniques in field, which are incomplete and
   labour-intensive. To overcome such difficulties, we study a model to
   transfer the pixels of multispectral satellite images to quantitative
   LCCs. The idea is to extend band ratio-based (BR) indices to a novel
   index constructed using the ratio of different linear combinations
   (RDLC) of band reflectance and water depths. On the basis of field
   surveyed LCCs, an empirical process is further proposed to solve the
   unknown parameters of this RDLC. This approach provides new thinking for
   designing LCC-sensitive indices for given multispectral satellite
   images. The experimental results on Weizhou Island and Palmyra Atoll
   demonstrate that the method is effective and feasible, where the mean
   relative errors (MREs) arc improved from 45 to 56\% for BRs to 23-29\%
   for RDLCs for Weizhou Island. (C) 2018 Optical Society of America under

Title = {Dissepiments, density bands and signatures of thermal stress in Porites
   skeletons},
Journal = {CORAL REEFS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {36},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {The skeletons of many reef-building corals are accreted with rhythmic
   structural patterns that serve as valuable sclerochronometers. Annual
   high- and low-density band couplets, visible in X-radiographs or
   computed tomography scans, are used to construct age models for
   paleoclimate reconstructions and to track variability in coral growth
   over time. In some corals, discrete, anomalously high-density bands,
   called ``stress bands,{''} preserve information about coral bleaching.
   However, the mechanisms underlying the formation of coral skeletal
   density banding remain unclear. Dissepiments thin, horizontal sheets of
   calcium carbonate accreted by the coral to support the living polyp play
   a key role in the upward growth of the colony. Here, we first conducted
   a vital staining experiment to test whether dissepiments were accreted
   with lunar periodicity in Porites coral skeleton, as previously
   hypothesized. Over 6, 15, and 21 months, dissepiments consistently
   formed in a 1:1 ratio to the number of full moons elapsed over each
   study period. We measured dissepiment spacing to reconstruct multiple
   years of monthly skeletal extension rates in two Porites colonies from
   Palmyra Atoll and in another from Palau that bleached in 1998 under
   anomalously high sea temperatures. Spacing between successive
   dissepiments exhibited strong seasonality in corals containing annual
   density bands, with narrow (wide) spacing associated with high (low)
   density, respectively. A high-density ``stress band{''} accreted during
   the 1998 bleaching event was associated with anomalously low dissepiment
   spacing and missed dissepiments, implying that thermal stress disrupts
   skeletal extension. Further, uranium/calcium ratios increased within
   stress bands, indicating a reduction in the carbonate ion concentration
   of the coral's calcifying fluid under stress. Our study verifies the
   lunar periodicity of dissepiments, provides a mechanistic basis for the
   formation of annual density bands in Porites, and reveals the underlying
   cause of high-density stress bands.},

Abstract = {Analyses of animal social networks have frequently benefited from
   techniques derived from other disciplines. Recently, machine learning
   algorithms have been adopted to infer social associations from
   time-series data gathered using remote, telemetry systems situated at
   provisioning sites. We adapt and modify existing inference methods to
   reveal the underlying social structure of wide-ranging marine predators
   moving through spatial arrays of passive acoustic receivers. From six
   months of tracking data for grey reef sharks (Carcharhinus
   amblyrhynchos) at Palmyra atoll in the Pacific Ocean, we demonstrate
   that some individuals emerge as leaders within the population and that
   this behavioural coordination is predicted by both sex and the duration
   of co-occurrences between conspecifics. In doing so, we provide the
   first evidence of long-term, spatially extensive social processes in
   wild sharks. To achieve these results, we interrogate simulated and real
   tracking data with the explicit purpose of drawing attention to the key
   considerations in the use and interpretation of inference methods and
   their impact on resultant social structure. We provide a modified
   translation of the GMMEvents method for R, including new analyses
   quantifying the directionality and duration of social events with the
   aim of encouraging the careful use of these methods more widely in less
   tractable social animal systems but where passive telemetry is already
   widespread.},

Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {10},

Abstract = {The Christmas tree hydroid Pennaria disticha is listed as one of the
   most common introduced species in Hawaii. Firstly reported in Kaneohe
   Bay (Oahu) in 1928, it is now established throughout the entire
   archipelago, including the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, a U.S.
   National Monument and World Heritage site. The Hawaiian population of P.
   disticha has also been reported as being the source of further
   introductions to Palmyra Atoll in the U.S. Line Islands. Using a
   phylogenetic hypothesis based on a 611 base pair fragment of the
   mitochondrial 16S barcoding gene, we demonstrate that P. disticha is a
   complex of cryptic species, rather than one species with cosmopolitan
   distribution. We also show that in Hawaii there are three species of
   Pennaria, rather than one introduced species. Two of these species share
   haplotypes with specimens from distant locations such as Florida and
   Panama and may have been introduced, possibly from the Atlantic Ocean. A
   third species could either represent a lineage with nearly cosmopolitan
   distribution, or another introduced species. Our dataset refutes the
   widely accepted idea that only one lineage of P. disticha is present in
   Hawaii. On the contrary, P. disticha in Hawaii may be the outcome of
   multiple independent introductions of several morphologically
   undistinguishable cryptic lineages. Our results uncover an unsuspected
   complexity within the very common hydroid P. disticha, and highlight the
   need for routine use of molecular tools, such as DNA barcoding, to
   improve the identification and recognition of non-indigenous species.},

Abstract = {Reconstructions of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) are often
   created using the oxygen isotopic ratio in tropical coral skeletons
   (delta O-18). However, coral delta O-18 can be difficult to interpret
   quantitatively, as it reflects changes in both temperature and the delta
   O-18 value of seawater. Small-scale (10-100 km) processes affecting
   local temperature and seawater delta O-18 are also poorly quantified and
   contribute an unknown amount to intercoral delta O-18 offsets. A new
   version of the Regional Ocean Modeling System capable of directly
   simulating seawater delta O-18 (isoROMS) is therefore presented to
   address these issues. The model is used to simulate delta O-18
   variations over the 1979-2009 period throughout the Pacific at coarse
   (O(50 km)) resolution, in addition to 10 km downscaling experiments
   covering the central equatorial Pacific Line Islands, a preferred site
   for paleo-ENSO reconstruction from corals. A major impact of downscaling
   at the Line Islands is the ability to resolve fronts associated with
   tropical instability waves (TIWs), which generate large excursions in
   both temperature and seawater delta O-18 at Palmyra Atoll (5.9 degrees
   N, 162.1 degrees W). TIW-related sea surface temperature gradients are
   smaller at neighboring Christmas Island (1.9 degrees N, 157.5 degrees
   W), but the interaction of mesoscale features with the steep island
   topography nonetheless generates cross-island temperature differences of
   up to 1 degrees C. These nonlinear processes alter the slope of the
   salinity: seawater delta O-18 relationship at Palmyra and Christmas, as
   well as affect the relation between coral delta O-18 and indices of ENSO
   variability. Consideration of the full physical oceanographic context of
   reef environments is therefore crucial for improving delta O-18-based
   ENSO reconstructions.},

Abstract = {Many terrestrial and marine species have a diel activity pattern, and
   their acoustic signaling follows their current behavioral state.
   Whistles and echolocation clicks on long-term recordings produced by
   melon-headed whales (Peponocephala electra) at Palmyra Atoll indicated
   that these signals were used selectively during different phases of the
   day, strengthening the idea of nighttime foraging and daytime resting
   with afternoon socializing for this species. Spectral features of their
   echolocation clicks changed from day to night, shifting the median
   center frequency up. Additionally, click received levels increased with
   increasing ambient noise during both day and night. Ambient noise over a
   wide frequency band was on average higher at night. The diel adjustment
   of click features might be a reaction to acoustic masking caused by
   these nighttime sounds. Similar adaptations have been documented for
   numerous taxa in response to noise. Or it could be, unrelated, an
   increase in biosonar source levels and with it a shift in center
   frequency to enhance detection distances during foraging at night. Call
   modifications in intensity, directionality, frequency, and duration
   according to echolocation task are well established for bats. This
   finding indicates that melon-headed whales have flexibility in their
   acoustic behavior, and they collectively and repeatedly adapt their
   signals from day- to nighttime circumstances.},

Abstract = {Fibropapillomatosis (FP) comprises a majority of green turtle stranding
   in Hawaii; however, green turtles in the Pacific are also susceptible to
   non-FP related causes of death. We present here necropsy findings from
   230 free-ranging green turtles originating from Hawaii, the Mariana
   archipelago, Palmyra Atoll, American Samoa, and Johnston Atoll that died
   from non-FP related causes. Most turtles died from fishing-induced or
   boat strike trauma followed by infectious/inflammatory diseases,
   nutritional problems (mainly cachexia), and an array of physiologic
   problems. Infectious/inflammatory problems included bacterial diseases
   of the lungs, eyes, liver or intestines, spirorchid fluke infection, or
   polyarthritis of unknown origin. Likelihood of a successful diagnosis of
   cause of death was a function of post-mortem decomposition.
   Fibropapillomatosis was not seen in turtles submitted from outside
   Hawaii. The preponderance of anthropogenic causes of mortality offers
   some management opportunities to mitigate causes of death in these
   animals by, for example, implementing measures to decrease boating and
   fishing interactions.},

Title = {Contrasting effects of ocean acidification on tropical fleshy and
   calcareous algae},
Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {2},
Month = {MAY 27},
Abstract = {Despite the heightened awareness of ocean acidification (OA) effects on
   marine organisms, few studies empirically juxtapose biological responses
   to CO2 manipulations across functionally distinct primary producers,
   particularly benthic algae. Algal responses to OA may vary because
   increasing CO2 has the potential to fertilize photosynthesis but impair
   biomineralization. Using a series of repeated experiments on Palmyra
   Atoll, simulated OA effects were tested across a suite of ecologically
   important coral reef algae, including five fleshy and six calcareous
   species. Growth, calcification and photophysiology were measured for
   each species independently and metrics were combined from each
   experiment using a meta-analysis to examine overall trends across
   functional groups categorized as fleshy, upright calcareous, and
   crustose coralline algae (CCA). The magnitude of the effect of OA on
   algal growth response varied by species, but the direction was
   consistent within functional groups. Exposure to OA conditions generally
   enhanced growth in fleshy macroalgae, reduced net calcification in
   upright calcareous algae, and caused net dissolution in CCA.
   Additionally, three of the five fleshy seaweeds tested became
   reproductive upon exposure to OA conditions. There was no consistent
   effect of OA on algal photophysiology. Our study provides experimental
   evidence to support the hypothesis that OA will reduce the ability of
   calcareous algae to biomineralize. Further, we show that CO2 enrichment
   either will stimulate population or somatic growth in some species of
   fleshy macroalgae. Thus, our results suggest that projected OA
   conditions may favor non-calcifying algae and influence the relative
   dominance of fleshy macroalgae on reefs, perpetuating or exacerbating
   existing shifts in reef community structure.},

Title = {Longevity of rodenticide bait pellets in a tropical environment

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {21},
Number = {3},
Pages = {2283-2288},

Abstract = {Invasive rodents (primarily Rattus spp.) are responsible for loss of
   biodiversity in island ecosystems worldwide. Large-scale rodenticide
   applications are typically used to eradicate rats and restore ecological
   communities. In tropical ecosystems, environmental conditions rapidly
   degrade baits and competition for baits by non-target animals can result
   in eradication failure. Our objective was to evaluate persistence of
   rodenticide baits during a rat eradication program on Palmyra Atoll; a
   remote tropical atoll with intense competition for resources by land
   crabs. Following aerial application, bait condition was monitored in
   four terrestrial environments and in the canopy foliage of coconut
   palms. Ten circular PVC hoops were fixed in place in each of Palmyra's
   four primary terrestrial habitats and five rodenticide pellets were
   placed in each hoop. Five coconut palms were selected in three distinct
   regions of the atoll. One rodenticide pellet was placed on each of five
   palm fronds in each coconut palm. Fresh baits were placed in all
   monitoring locations after each broadcast bait application. Bait
   condition and survival was monitored for 7 days after the first bait
   application and 6 days after second application. Bait survival curves
   differed between applications at most monitoring sites, suggesting a
   decrease in overall rat activity as a result of rodenticide treatment.
   One terrestrial site showed near 100 \% bait survival after both
   applications, likely due to low localized rat and crab densities. Median
   days to pellet disappearance were one and two days for the first and
   second application, respectively. Differences in survival curves were
   not detected in canopy sites between bait applications. Median days to
   pellet disappearance in canopy sites were 2 and 4 days for the first and
   second application, respectively. Frequent rainfall likely contributed
   to rapid degradation of bait pellets in coconut palm fronds.},

Title = {Extreme phenotypic polymorphism in the coral genus Pocillopora;
   micro-morphology corresponds to mitochondrial groups, while colony

Journal = {BULLETIN OF MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {90},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Coral species are difficult to identify due to few distinct
   morphological features and high levels of phenotypic variation;
   furthermore, hybridization is thought to play an important role in coral
   evolution. The genus Pocillopora is one of the most abundant
   reef-building corals in the Pacific, yet species boundaries within this
   important group remain enigmatic, with conflicting interpretations of
   molecular data. To further examine the relationship between morphology
   and genetic variation, we examined in situ photographs, microscopic
   images, and molecular markers (ORF, CR, ITS-2) from 59 Pocillopora
   colonies representing a range of atypical morphologies thought to be
   rare or endemic to remote locations (the Hawaiian Archipelago, Johnston
   Atoll, Palmyra Atoll, and Howland Island). Additionally, we combined our
   data with previously published genetic data from the western Indian
   Ocean, Taiwan, the Great Barrier Reef, and the tropical east Pacific (n
   = 298) to examine phylogeographic relationships more broadly.
   Mitochondrial markers revealed six distinct clades, while nuclear data
   (ITS-2) resolved no clear groups due in part to intragenomic variation.
   Although colony-level morphology is highly variable within each
   mitochondrial clade, microscopic corallite-level morphology showed less
   variation and stronger concordance with mitochondrial groups, and one
   clade was found only in the Hawaiian Archipelago. These findings will
   assist with efforts to delineate species boundaries in the genus
   Pocillopora and contribute to understanding the scale of species-level
   variation in reef building corals. Accurate determination of species
   boundaries will improve conservation efforts and further our
   understanding of the evolution and biodiversity of reef building corals.},

Abstract = {Coral reefs are highly diverse eco systems where symbioses play a
   pivotal role. Corals contain cell-associated microbial aggregates
   (CAMA), yet little is known about how widespread they are among coral
   species or the nature of the symbio tic relationship. Using histology,
   we found CAMA within 24 species of corals from 6 genera from Hawaii,
   American Samoa, Palmyra, Johnston Atoll, Guam, and Australia. Prevalence
   (\%) of infection varied among coral genera: Acropora, Porites, and
   Pocillopora were commonly infected whereas Montipora were not. Acropora
   from the Western Pacific were significantly more likely to be infected
   with CAMA than those from the Central Pacific, whereas the reverse was
   true for Porites. Compared with apparently healthy colonies, tissues
   from diseased colonies were significantly more likely to have both
   surface and basal body walls infected. The close association of CAMA
   with host cells in numerous species of apparently healthy corals and
   lack of associated cell pathology reveals an intimate agent-host
   association. Furthermore, CAMA are Gram negative and in some corals may
   be related to chlamydia or rickettsia. We propose that CAMA in adult
   corals are facultative secondary symbionts that could play an important
   ecological role in some dominant coral genera in the Indo-Pacific. CAMA
   are important in the life histories of other animals, and more work is
   needed to understand their role in the distribution, evolution,
   physiology, and immunology of reef corals.},

Title = {Quantifying Climatological Ranges and Anomalies for Pacific Coral Reef
   Ecosystems},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {8},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR 18},
Abstract = {Coral reef ecosystems are exposed to a range of environmental forcings
   that vary on daily to decadal time scales and across spatial scales
   spanning from reefs to archipelagos. Environmental variability is a
   major determinant of reef ecosystem structure and function, including
   coral reef extent and growth rates, and the abundance, diversity, and
   morphology of reef organisms. Proper characterization of environmental
   forcings on coral reef ecosystems is critical if we are to understand
   the dynamics and implications of abiotic-biotic interactions on reef
   ecosystems. This study combines high-resolution bathymetric information
   with remotely sensed sea surface temperature, chlorophyll-a and
   irradiance data, and modeled wave data to quantify environmental
   forcings on coral reefs. We present a methodological approach to develop
   spatially constrained, island-and atoll-scale metrics that quantify
   climatological range limits and anomalous environmental forcings across
   U. S. Pacific coral reef ecosystems. Our results indicate considerable
   spatial heterogeneity in climatological ranges and anomalies across 41
   islands and atolls, with emergent spatial patterns specific to each
   environmental forcing. For example, wave energy was greatest at northern
   latitudes and generally decreased with latitude. In contrast,
   chlorophyll-a was greatest at reef ecosystems proximate to the equator
   and northern-most locations, showing little synchrony with latitude. In
   addition, we find that the reef ecosystems with the highest
   chlorophyll-a concentrations; Jarvis, Howland, Baker, Palmyra and
   Kingman are each uninhabited and are characterized by high hard coral
   cover and large numbers of predatory fishes. Finally, we find that
   scaling environmental data to the spatial footprint of individual
   islands and atolls is more likely to capture local environmental
   forcings, as chlorophyll-a concentrations decreased at relatively short
   distances (>7 km) from 85\% of our study locations. These metrics will
   help identify reef ecosystems most exposed to environmental stress as
   well as systems that may be more resistant or resilient to future
   climate change.},

Abstract = {We used mitochondrial and nuclear genetic markers to investigate
   population structure of common bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops truncatus,
   around the main Hawaiian Islands. Though broadly distributed throughout
   the world's oceans, bottlenose dolphins are known to form small
   populations in coastal waters. Recent photo-identification data suggest
   the same is true in Hawaiian waters. We found genetic differentiation
   among (mtDNA FST= 0.0140.141, microsatellite FST= 0.0190.050) and low
   dispersal rates between (0.175.77 dispersers per generation) the main
   Hawaiian Island groups. Our results are consistent with movement rates
   estimated from photo-identification data and suggest that each island
   group supports a demographically independent population. Inclusion in
   our analyses of samples collected near Palmyra Atoll provided evidence
   that the Hawaiian Islands are also occasionally visited by members of a
   genetically distinct, pelagic population. Two of our samples exhibited
   evidence of partial ancestry from Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (T.
   aduncus), a species not known to inhabit the Hawaiian Archipelago. Our
   findings have important implications for the management of Hawaiian
   bottlenose dolphins and raise concerns about the vulnerability to human
   impacts of pelagic species in island ecosystems.},

Abstract = {Many odontocetes produce frequency modulated tonal calls known as
   whistles. The ability to automatically determine time x frequency tracks
   corresponding to these vocalizations has numerous applications including
   species description, identification, and density estimation. This work
   develops and compares two algorithms on a common corpus of nearly one
   hour of data collected in the Southern California Bight and at Palmyra
   Atoll. The corpus contains over 3000 whistles from bottlenose dolphins,
   long- and short-beaked common dolphins, spinner dolphins, and
   melon-headed whales that have been annotated by a human, and released to
   the Moby Sound archive. Both algorithms use a common signal processing
   front end to determine time x frequency peaks from a spectrogram. In the
   first method, a particle filter performs Bayesian filtering, estimating
   the contour from the noisy spectral peaks. The second method uses an
   adaptive polynomial prediction to connect peaks into a graph, merging
   graphs when they cross. Whistle contours are extracted from graphs using
   information from both sides of crossings. The particle filter was able
   to retrieve 71.5\% (recall) of the human annotated tonals with 60.8\% of
   the detections being valid (precision). The graph algorithm's recall
   rate was 80.0\% with a precision of 76.9\%. (C) 2011 Acoustical Society

Title = {Predator-Induced Demographic Shifts in Coral Reef Fish Assemblages},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {6},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN 16},
Abstract = {In recent years, it has become apparent that human impacts have altered
   community structure in coastal and marine ecosystems worldwide. Of
   these, fishing is one of the most pervasive, and a growing body of work
   suggests that fishing can have strong effects on the ecology of target
   species, especially top predators. However, the effects of removing top
   predators on lower trophic groups of prey fishes are less clear,
   particularly in highly diverse and trophically complex coral reef
   ecosystems. We examined patterns of abundance, size structure, and
   age-based demography through surveys and collection-based studies of
   five fish species from a variety of trophic levels at Kiritimati and
   Palmyra, two nearby atolls in the Northern Line Islands. These islands
   have similar biogeography and oceanography, and yet Kiritimati has
   similar to 10,000 people with extensive local fishing while Palmyra is a
   US National Wildlife Refuge with no permanent human population, no
   fishing, and an intact predator fauna. Surveys indicated that top
   predators were relatively larger and more abundant at unfished Palmyra,
   while prey functional groups were relatively smaller but showed no clear
   trends in abundance as would be expected from classic trophic cascades.
   Through detailed analyses of focal species, we found that size and
   longevity of a top predator were lower at fished Kiritimati than at
   unfished Palmyra. Demographic patterns also shifted dramatically for 4
   of 5 fish species in lower trophic groups, opposite in direction to the
   top predator, including decreases in average size and longevity at
   Palmyra relative to Kiritimati. Overall, these results suggest that
   fishing may alter community structure in complex and non-intuitive ways,
   and that indirect demographic effects should be considered more broadly
   in ecosystem-based management.},

Abstract = {The pharaoh ant, Monomorium pharaonis (LiNNAEUS, 1758), has long been
   considered the most ubiquitous house ant in the world. Monomorium
   pharaonis is particularly notorious as a pest in hospitals, where it is
   known as a vector for disease. I compiled and mapped specimen records of
   M. pharaonis from > 1200 sites to document its known worldwide
   distribution and evaluate hypotheses concerning its geographic origin. I
   documented the earliest known M. pharaonis records for 225 geographic
   areas (countries, island groups, major islands, US states, Canadian
   provinces, and Russian federal districts), including many for which I
   found no previously published records: Austral Islands, Central African
   Republic, Delaware, Dominican Republic, Gabon, Guatemala, Hainan Island,
   Haiti, Iraq, Ivory Coast, Maine, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New
   Hampshire, Pakistan, Palmyra Atoll, Rhode Island, Tunisia, and West
   Virginia. In tropical areas, M pharaonis occurs both indoors and out,
   but in temperate areas, it is found almost exclusively indoors. It is by
   far the most common tropical ant found in heated buildings of Europe and
   North America.
   Monomorium pharaonis appears to have originated in tropical Asia, where
   widespread outdoor records have been reported. Also, Monomorium longi
   FOREL, 1902 and Monomorium wroughtoni FOREL, 1902, the two species
   thought to be most closely related to M. pharaonis, are endemic to
   tropical Asia. Although M. pharaonis was first described from Egypt, I
   found no evidence supporting the popular, but apparently mistaken, idea
   that M. pharaonis is native to Africa.
   Numerous authors contend that M. pharaonis populations are rapidly
   expanding. My analyses, however, suggest that M. pharaonis had already
   spread over much of the world > 100 years ago. Much of the purportedly
   recent population increases of M. pharaonis may be an artifact of
   greater sampling and dissemination of information.},

   modeling study},
Journal = {GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {37},
Month = {MAR 19},
Abstract = {The role of tropical Pacific SSTs in driving global medieval
   hydroclimate is assessed. Using fossil coral records from Palmyra Atoll,
   tropical Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) boundary conditions are
   derived for the period 1320-1462 A. D. These boundary conditions consist
   of La Nina-like mean state conditions in the tropical Pacific with
   inter-annual and decadal variability about that altered state. The
   reconstructed SSTs in the tropical Pacific are used to force a 16 member
   ensemble of atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) simulations,
   coupled to a one layer ocean model outside of the tropical Pacific. The
   AGCM simulations of medieval climate are compared with modern climate
   simulations for the period 1856-2005 A. D. and are shown to reproduce
   many aspects of medieval hydroclimate found in paleo-proxy records for
   much of the Western Hemisphere, northern Eurasia, and the northern
   tropics. These results suggest that many features of global medieval
   hydroclimate changes can be explained by changes in tropical Pacific
   SSTs, though the potential role for other oceans is also discussed.

Title = {A Verified Estimation of the El Nino Index Nino-3.4 since 1877},

Abstract = {Decadal and longer time-scale variabilities of the best known El
   Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) indexes are poorly correlated before
   1950, and so knowledge of interdecadal variability and trend in ENSO
   indexes is dubious, especially before 1950. To address this problem, the
   authors constructed and compared physically related monthly ENSO
   indexes. The base index was El Nino index Nino-3.4, the sea surface
   temperature (SST) anomaly averaged over the equatorial box bounded by 5
   degrees N, 5 degrees S, 170 degrees W, and 120 degrees W; the authors
   also constructed indexes based on the nighttime marine air temperature
   over the Nino-3.4 region (NMAT3.4) and an equatorial Southern
   Oscillation index (ESOI). The Nino-3.4 index used the ``uninterpolated''
   sea surface temperature data from the Second Hadley Centre Sea Surface
   Temperature dataset (HadSST2), a dataset with smaller uncertainty and
   better geographical coverage than others. In constructing the index,
   data at each point for a given month were weighted to take into account
   the typical considerable spatial variation of the SST anomaly over the
   Nino-3.4 box as well as the number of observations at that point for
   that month. Missing monthly data were interpolated and ``noise'' was
   reduced by using the result that Nino-3.4 has essentially the same
   calendar month amplitude structure every year. This 12-point calendar
   month structure from April to March was obtained by an EOF analysis over
   the last 58 yr and then was fitted to the entire monthly time series
   using a least squares approach. Equivalent procedures were followed for
   NMAT3.4 and ESOI. The new ESOI uses Darwin atmospheric pressure in the
   west and is based on theory that allows for variations of the
   atmospheric boundary layer depth across the Pacific.
   The new Nino-3.4 index was compared with NMAT3.4, the new ESOI, and with
   a record of delta O-18 from a coral at Palmyra, an atoll inside the
   region Nino-3.4 (Cobb et al.). Correlation coefficients between Nino-3.4
   and the three monthly indexes mentioned above before 1950 are 0.84,
   0.87, 0.73 and 0.93, 0.86, 0.73 for decadal time scales. These
   relatively high correlation coefficients between physically related but
   independent monthly time series suggest that this study has improved
   knowledge of low-frequency variability. All four indexes are consistent
   with a rise in Nino-3.4 SST and the weakening of the equatorial Pacific
   winds since about 1970.},

Title = {Tropical Pacific Forcing of North American Medieval Megadroughts:
   Testing the Concept with an Atmosphere Model Forced by
   Coral-Reconstructed SSTs},

Abstract = {The possible role that tropical Pacific SSTs played in driving the
   megadroughts over North America during the medieval period is addressed.
   Fossil coral records from the Palmyra Atoll are used to derive tropical
   Pacific SSTs for the period from A. D. 1320 to A. D. 1462 and show
   overall colder conditions as well as extended multidecadal La Nina-like
   states. The reconstructed SSTs are used to force a 16-member ensemble of
   atmosphere GCM simulations, each with different initial conditions, with
   the atmosphere coupled to a mixed layer ocean outside of the tropical
   Pacific. Model results are verified against North American tree ring
   reconstructions of the Palmer Drought Severity Index. A singular value
   decomposition analysis is performed using the soil moisture anomaly
   simulated by another 16-member ensemble of simulations forced by global
   observed SSTs for 1856-2004 and tree ring reconstructions of the Palmer
   Drought Severity Index for the same period. This relationship is used to
   transfer the modeled medieval soil moisture anomaly (relative to the
   modern simulation) into a model-estimated Palmer Drought Severity Index.
   The model-estimated Palmer Drought Severity Index reproduces many
   aspects of both the interannual and decadal variations of the tree ring
   reconstructions, in addition to an overall drier climate that is drier
   than the tree ring records suggest. The model-estimated Palmer Drought
   Severity Index simulates two previously identified ``megadroughts,{''}
   A. D. 1360-1400 and A. D. 1430-60, with a realistic spatial pattern and
   amplitude. In contrast, the model fails to produce a period of more
   normal conditions in the early fifteenth century that separated these
   two megadroughts. The dynamical link between tropical SSTs and the North
   American megadroughts is akin to that operating in modern droughts. The
   model results are used to argue that the tropical Pacific played an
   active role in driving the megadroughts. However, the match between
   simulated and reconstructed hydroclimate is such that it is likely that
   both the coral-reconstructed SST anomalies contain significant errors
   and that SST anomalies in other basins also played a role in driving
   hydroclimate variations over North America during the late medieval
   period.},

Abstract = {Little is known of the timing of reproduction in central Pacific coral
   populations near the equator. Oocyte pigmentation and size comparison
   with sizes of mature eggs reported in published literature were used to
   infer intra- and interspecific synchrony and probable spawning phenology
   in 15 species of Acropora from Palmyra and Kingman atolls in the
   northern Line Islands. Sampling at both atolls took place in March-April
   2002 and 2004. Oocyte sizes were determined from microdissections of
   fixed, decalcified samples. The majority (91.2\%) of samples (n = 209)
   were gravid, with high levels of fertility in most (84.3\%) samples.
   Statistically discrete oocyte size classes could be distinguished in
   most taxa at each atoll in each year. These discrete oocyte size classes
   suggest that several episodes of spawning, involving multiple species,
   take place over 2 or 3 months beginning in early spring. These data,
   which are the first observations of coral reproductive synchrony in the
   Line Islands, support the results of other recent studies, suggesting
   that reproductive synchrony can be a feature of equatorial reef
   assemblages where the annual ranges of sea-surface temperature and tidal
   amplitude are small.},

Abstract = {Distant tropical coral sand islets in the Coral Sea have remained
   isolated from major human interference since their relatively recent
   inception. As a result they have highly impoverished faunas and floras
   consisting only of species capable of long distance dispersal. Despite
   this bias, they have established some degree of stability or
   equilibrium. In the 1990s, it became apparent that a scale insect,
   Pulvinaria urbicola Cockerell and at least one species of attendant ant,
   Tetramorium bicarinatum (Nylander) were undergoing a population
   explosion on two of these islets causing damage to Pisonia grandis, a
   tree important as a nesting site for sea birds. The same phenomenon as
   in the Coral Sea, (Coringa Herald group), was recorded about the same
   time in the Capricorn group of islets (Great Barrier Reef), on Palmyra
   Atoll and Samoa in the Pacific and in the Seychelles (Indian Ocean).
   Control measures, the application of systemic insecticides, poisoning of
   attendant ants and introduction of biological control agents were
   applied to some islands. Pest numbers subsequently fell, often within
   months, even where no control measures were applied, suggesting that the
   population decline was a natural phenomenon on some sites and not the
   result of recent invasions. It is suggested that climate variability is
   likely to be a contributing factor. Rising sea surface temperatures that
   reduce prey available to sea birds so causing a lower nitrogen input to
   soils during nesting activities, together with drier conditions, are
   likely to have put Pisonia trees under stress. Stressed trees mobilise
   nutrients making them more vulnerable to attack by herbivores. If
   climate variability is an indirect cause of the pest outbreak, it is
   important to carefully assess the benefits and disadvantages, both
   environmentally and economically, of any control measures, especially
   when biological control agents are concerned, the effects of which are
   irreversible.},

Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {3},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB 27},
Abstract = {Effective conservation requires rigorous baselines of pristine
   conditions to assess the impacts of human activities and to evaluate the
   efficacy of management. Most coral reefs are moderately to severely
   degraded by local human activities such as fishing and pollution as well
   as global change, hence it is difficult to separate local from global
   effects. To this end, we surveyed coral reefs on uninhabited atolls in
   the northern Line Islands to provide a baseline of reef community
   structure, and on increasingly populated atolls to document changes
   associated with human activities. We found that top predators and
   reef-building organisms dominated unpopulated Kingman and Palmyra, while
   small planktivorous fishes and fleshy algae dominated the populated
   atolls of Tabuaeran and Kiritimati. Sharks and other top predators
   overwhelmed the fish assemblages on Kingman and Palmyra so that the
   biomass pyramid was inverted (top-heavy). In contrast, the biomass
   pyramid at Tabuaeran and Kiritimati exhibited the typical bottom-heavy
   pattern. Reefs without people exhibited less coral disease and greater
   coral recruitment relative to more inhabited reefs. Thus, protection
   from overfishing and pollution appears to increase the resilience of
   reef ecosystems to the effects of global warming.},

Abstract = {Freshwater eels In the family Anguillidae spend a majority of their
   adult life In freshwater but migrate to the ocean to spawn and (lie.
   Because freshwater eels are believed to have a long larval period in the
   open ocean, it is unclear how the present global distribution of species
   arose. A stock of freshwater eels of the family Anguillidae was found
   oil Palmyra Atoll in the central Pacific Ocean, In June 2003. In October
   2003, a single eel specimen was caught using a]land net from this small
   group of eels oil Palmyra Atoll. Morphological and molecular characters
   (12S and 16S mitochondrial rRNA and cytochrome 1) mtDNA sequences) were
   used to identify the species as Anguilla marmorata Quoy \& Gaimard. The
   discovery of these eels oil Palmyra supports the hypothesis of natural
   range expansion from the Indo-Pacific eastward to the Galapagos through
   the Line Islands, but further analysis of oceanic Currents and more
   variable genes are required to assess whether humans are involved in the
   recent spread of Anguilla marmorata to these new locations.},

Abstract = {Behavioral interactions such as dominance are critical components of
   animal social lives, competitive abilities, and resulting distribution
   patterns with coexisting species. Strong interference competition can
   drive habitat separation, but less is known of the role of interference
   if agonistic interactions are weak. While most theoretical models assume
   interference abilities to be constant in an environment, few consider
   that the extent of interference can vary by habitat and change model
   predictions. Using baited underwater cameras, we show a consistent
   dominance status between two sympatric reef sharks at an uninhabited
   Pacific atoll. Blacktip reef shark (Carcharhinus melanopterus) and gray
   reef shark (Carcharhinus amblyrhyncos) relative abundance showed an
   inverse relationship to each other but the strength of this relationship
   varied by habitat. Reef shark relative abundance declined more rapidly
   in the presence of heterospecifics on forereef habitats as opposed to
   backreefs. In all habitats, gray reef sharks were more likely to bite
   bait cages than blacktips when both species were present, and appeared
   to be the dominant species. Intraspecific interactions were also
   apparent, with individual willingness to bite bait decreasing as the
   number of conspecifics increased. Gray reef sharks may exert
   differential control over blacktip foraging success in different
   habitats. Habitat-specific behavioral interactions may partially explain
   patterns of spatial separation between competing species where
   interference is weak.},

Title = {Biophysical drivers of coral trophic depth zonation},
Journal = {MARINE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {165},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Depth is used often as a proxy for gradients in energetic resources on
   coral reefs and for predicting patterns of community energy use. With
   increasing depth, loss of light can lead to a reduced reliance on
   autotrophy and an increased reliance on heterotrophy by mixotrophic
   corals. However, the generality of such trophic zonation varies across
   contexts. By combining high-resolution oceanographic measurements with
   isotopic analyses (delta C-13, delta N-15) of multiple producer and
   consumer levels across depths (10-30 m) at a central Pacific oceanic
   atoll, we show trophic zonation in mixotrophic corals can be both
   present and absent within the same reef system. Deep-water internal
   waves that deliver cool particulate-rich waters to shallow reefs
   occurred across all sites (2.5-5.6 events week(-1) at 30 m) but the
   majority of events remained depth-restricted (4.3-9.7\% recorded at 30 m
   propagated to 10 m). In the absence of other particulate delivery,
   mixotrophs increased their relative degree of heterotrophy with
   increasing depth. However, where relatively long-lasting downwelling
   events (1.4-3.3 times the duration of any other site) occurred
   simultaneously, mixotrophs displayed elevated and consistent degrees of
   heterotrophy regardless of depth. Importantly, these long-lasting
   surface pulses were of a lagoonal origin, an area of rich heterotrophic
   resource supply. Under such circumstances, we hypothesize heterotrophic
   resource abundance loses its direct linkage with depth and, with
   resources readily available at all depths, trophic zonation is no longer
   present. Our results show that fine-scale intra-island hydrographic
   regimes and hydrodynamic connectivity between reef habitats contribute
   to explaining the context specific nature of coral trophic depth
   zonation in shallow reef ecosystems.},

Title = {Porites coral response to an oceanographic and human impact gradient in

Volume = {62},

Abstract = {Coral bleaching caused by heat stress (warm water) will arguably be the
   greatest driver of coral reef loss in the coming decades. Understanding
   how corals have adapted to distinct oceanographic regimes on multiple
   scales can provide insight into future tolerance and persistence,
   information critical to directed intervention or targeted protections.
   The northern Line Islands span a gradient in oceanographic regimes
   across latitudes, with seawater becoming warmer, fresher, more
   oligotrophic, and more saturated with aragonite away from the equator.
   The combination of this regional gradient and island-scale (local)
   conditions was used as a natural experiment against which to test how
   massive Porites corals respond to these background conditions and
   episodic heat stress. We found that coral condition, represented by a
   metric combining tissue thickness, lipids, and calcification, was
   similar at almost all islands, though there were differences in how
   corals allocate resources among these biological parameters. Corals at
   Teraina, the most densely inhabited island, showed evidence for reduced
   calcification, potentially associated with human impacts and/or outflow
   of freshwater from the island. In contrast, Porites corals at Palmyra, a
   wildlife reserve, exhibited unexpectedly high tissue-condition metrics
   for its latitude, suggesting an additional food source, possibly
   plankton-rich lagoonal outflow. We did not find a strong relationship
   between human habitation and the response of Porites corals to recent
   heat stress. However, differences in coral calcification rates and
   energy stores between observed values and those expected based solely on
   the regional oceanographic gradient, suggests local effects have
   indirect impacts on these corals.},

Title = {Coral reef benthic regimes exhibit non-linear threshold responses to
   natural physical drivers},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {522},
Pages = {33-48},
Month = {MAR 2},
Abstract = {We assessed the independent effects of natural physical drivers in
   structuring coral reef benthic communities at a remote oceanic atoll in
   the central equatorial Pacific with minimal local human impacts.
   High-resolution bathymetric data combined with in situ oceanographic
   measurements and a nearshore hydrodynamic model revealed complex
   intra-atoll gradients in geomorphic complexity, wave forcing, currents,
   and temperature. For example, maximum wave-driven bed shear stress
   spatially varied on the forereef (15-20 m depth) by over 2 orders of
   magnitude, peaking in areas exposed to multiple wave regimes. Benthic
   community composition, quantified via towed-diver imagery collected in a
   complete circumnavigation of the atoll (similar to 40 km), also
   exhibited considerable spatial heterogeneity. Benthic competitors showed
   distinct, non-linear threshold-type responses to variations in physical
   drivers. For example, at a wave-driven bed shear stress threshold of 18
   N m(-2), calcifying crustose coralline algae lost relative dominance and
   were replaced by non-calcifying fleshy turf algae. Hard coral
   communities also demonstrated considerable flexibility in response to
   physical drivers, with distinct shifts in the relative dominance of
   different growth morphologies along gradients of wave forcing,
   presumably as a means of local adaptation. Our results highlight (1) the
   importance of natural gradients in physical drivers in determining
   dominant benthic regimes on coral reefs (e.g. calcifying vs. fleshy),
   (2) that non-linear thresholds (or tipping points) exist between key
   benthic competitors in response to key physical drivers, and (3) that
   coral assemblages show inherent flexibility and can reorganize in
   response to physical drivers rather than exhibit wholesale changes in
   overall cover.},

Abstract = {To assess genetic connectivity in a common and abundant goatfish (family
   Mullidae), we surveyed 637 specimens of Parupeneus multifasciatus (Quoy
   and Gaimard, 1825) from 15 locations in the Hawaiian Islands plus
   Johnston Atoll, two locations in the Line Islands, two locations in
   French Polynesia, and two locations in the northwestern Pacific. Based
   on mitochondrial cytochrome b sequences, we found no evidence of
   population structure across Hawaii and the North Pacific; however, we
   observed genetic structuring between northern and southern Pacific
   locations with the equator-straddling Line Islands affiliated with the
   southern population. The Marquesas Islands sample in the South Pacific

Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},

Month = {MAY 17},
Abstract = {Human impact on biodiversity usually is measured by reduction in species
   abundance or richness. Just as important, but much more difficult to
   discern, is the anthropogenic elimination of ecological interactions.
   Here we report on the persistence of a long ecological interaction chain
   linking diverse food webs and habitats in the near-pristine portions of
   a remote Pacific atoll. Using biogeochemical assays, animal tracking,
   and field surveys we show that seabirds roosting on native trees
   fertilize soils, increasing coastal nutrients and the abundance of
   plankton, thus attracting manta rays to native forest coastlines.
   Partnered observations conducted in regions of this atoll where native
   trees have been replaced by human propagated palms reveal that this
   complex interaction chain linking trees to mantas readily breaks down.
   Taken together these findings provide a compelling example of how
   anthropogenic disturbance may be contributing to widespread reductions
   in ecological interaction chain length, thereby isolating and
   simplifying ecosystems.},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The Line Islands are calcium carbonate coral reef platforms located in
   iron-poor regions of the central Pacific. Natural terrestrial run-off of
   iron is non-existent and aerial deposition is extremely low. However, a
   number of ship groundings have occurred on these atolls. The reefs
   surrounding the shipwreck debris are characterized by high benthic cover
   of turf algae, macroalgae, cyanobacterial mats and corallimorphs, as
   well as particulate-laden, cloudy water. These sites also have very low
   coral and crustose coralline algal cover and are call black reefs
   because of the dark-colored benthic community and reduced clarity of the
   overlying water column. Here we use a combination of benthic surveys,
   chemistry, metagenomics and microcosms to investigate if and how
   shipwrecks initiate and maintain black reefs. Comparative surveys show
   that the live coral cover was reduced from 40 to 60\% to <10\% on black
   reefs on Millennium, Tabuaeran and Kingman. These three sites are
   relatively large (>0.75 km(2)). The phase shift occurs rapidly; the
   Kingman black reef formed within 3 years of the ship grounding. Iron
   concentrations in algae tissue from the Millennium black reef site were
   six times higher than in algae collected from reference sites.
   Metagenomic sequencing of the Millennium Atoll black reef-associated
   microbial community was enriched in iron-associated virulence genes and
   known pathogens. Microcosm experiments showed that corals were killed by
   black reef rubble through microbial activity. Together these results
   demonstrate that shipwrecks and their associated iron pose significant
   threats to coral reefs in iron-limited regions. The ISME Journal (2012)

Abstract = {Animals across vertebrate taxa form social communities and often exist
   as fission-fusion groups. Central place foragers (CPF) may form groups
   from which they will predictably disperse to forage, either individually
   or in smaller groups, before returning to fuse with the larger group.
   However, the function and stability of social associations in predatory
   fish acting as CPFs is unknown, as individuals do not need to return to
   a shelter yet show fidelity to core areas. Using dynamic social networks
   generated from acoustic tracking data, we document spatially structured
   sociality in CPF grey reef sharks at a Pacific Ocean atoll. We show that
   sharks form stable social groups over multiyear periods, with some
   dyadic associations consistent for up to 4 years. Groups primarily
   formed during the day, increasing in size throughout the morning before
   sharks dispersed from the reef at night. Our simulations suggest that
   multiple individuals sharing a central place and using social
   information while foraging (i.e. local enhancement) will outperform
   non-CPF social foragers. We show multiyear social stability in sharks
   and suggest that social foraging with information transfer could provide
   a generalizable mechanism for the emergence of sociality with group
   central place foraging.},

Title = {Coral larvae change their settlement preference for crustose coralline
   algae dependent on availability of bare space},
Journal = {CORAL REEFS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {37},
Number = {2},
Pages = {397-407},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Competition for space is a major factor affecting coral survival. Since
   adult coral colonies are sessile, the settlement preferences of larvae
   have a strong impact on the competition for space that corals will face
   post-metamorphosis and will therefore influence long-term survival.
   Laboratory-based studies show that in simplified systems coral larvae
   use cues to guide them to suitable settlement locations, an adaptation
   that enhances post-settlement survival. Settlement preferences have also
   been reported from the field, where coral larvae encounter a wide
   variety of different potential settlement surfaces as the availability
   of free substratum (bare space) changes over time. In this field-based
   study, the abundance of different encrusting organisms and bare space
   present on settlement tiles was compared to their abundance under newly
   settled pocilloporid and poritid recruits, to determine if recruits
   choose their settlement substratum randomly. Tiles deployed for 3, 9, 12
   and 15 months were used to determine if settlement choice varied as a
   function of benthic community successional stage. We found that
   pocilloporid and poritid larvae changed their settlement preference
   depending on the age of the benthic community they encountered. They
   reacted neutrally to crustose coralline algae (CCA) on tiles deployed
   for 3 months when bare space was abundant, but showed a clear preference
   for settlement on CCA on tiles deployed for 9-15 months once bare space
   was limited. Simultaneously, poritid recruits showed a decreasing
   preference over time to settle on biofilm. This change in preference is
   not linked to the availability of CCA because its abundance did not
   change significantly between tiles deployed for 3 versus 9-15 months.
   These results indicate that coral recruits react to several settlement
   cues simultaneously, guiding them to different settlement locations as
   the benthos changes over time. Furthermore, recruits from both families
   reacted similarly, suggesting that this is an evolutionarily old
   adaption.},

   factors in affecting spatial foraging behaviors of mobile herbivorous
   fishes. In the current study we quantified space use and feeding rates
   of the parrotfish, Chlorurus spilurus, across a strong gradient of food
   resources and predator and competitor abundance across two islands with
   drastically different fisheries management schemes. We found evidence
   that while feeding rates of this species are affected by direct
   interference competition and chronic predation risk, space use appears
   to be primarily related to exploitative competition with the surrounding
   herbivore community. We found no evidence that predation risk influences
   diurnal foraging space use in this small bodied parrotfish species.
   Additionally, we found the influence of chronic predation risk on
   feeding rates of this species to be less dramatic than the results of
   recent studies that used model predators to measure acute behavioral
   responses of other species of herbivorous fishes. Our results indicate
   that the non-consumptive effects of predators on the foraging behaviors
   of coral reef herbivores may be less dramatic than previously thought.},

Abstract = {Growth anomalies (GAs) in scleractinian corals drain energy from the
   host and can result in partial or entire colony mortality. Here I show
   that growth anomaly removal is an effective treatment for the branching
   coral Acropora acuminata, with 90\% of subjects remaining GA-free 9 mo
   following the procedure. In contrast, the encrusting coral Montipora
   efflorescens did not respond positively to treatment, with GAs
   re-developing in 100\% of treated subjects. There was no clear evidence
   that injuries sustained during GA removal increased susceptibility to GA
   development in either coral species. Based on these results, I
   hypothesize that the factors inducing GAs in Acropora acuminata are
   localized, whereas those in Montipora efflorescens appear more systemic
   throughout the colony-perhaps the result of a genetically-based factor,
   or a persistent causative agent such as a virus. GA removal may
   therefore be effective for targeted rescues of particular coral species
   and morphologies in reef systems with low overall disease prevalence and
   is likely to be most effective for scleractinian corals if complimented
   by management actions that address the ultimate drivers of GAs on coral
   reefs.},

Volume = {22},

Abstract = {Accurately surveying shark populations is critical to monitoring
   precipitous ongoing declines in shark abundance and interpreting the
   effects that these reductions are having on ecosystems. To evaluate the
   effectiveness of existing survey tools, we used field trials and
   computer simulations to critically examine the operation of four common
   methods for counting coastal sharks: stationary point counts, belt
   transects, video surveys, and mark and recapture abundance estimators.
   Empirical and theoretical results suggest that (1) survey method
   selection has a strong impact on the estimates of shark density that are
   produced, (2) standardizations by survey duration are needed to properly
   interpret and compare survey outputs, (3) increasing survey size does
   not necessarily increase survey precision, and (4) methods that yield
   the highest density estimates are not always the most accurate. These
   findings challenge some of the assumptions traditionally associated with
   surveying mobile marine animals. Of the methods we trialed, 8 X 50 m
   belt transects and a 20 m radius point count. produced the most accurate
   estimates of shark density. These findings can help to improve the ways
   we monitor, manage, and understand the ecology of globally imperiled
   coastal shark populations.},

Title = {Field evidence for pervasive indirect effects of fishing on prey
   foraging behavior},
Journal = {ECOLOGY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {91},
Number = {12},
Pages = {3563-3571},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The indirect, ecosystem-level consequences of ocean fishing, and
   particularly the mechanisms driving them, are poorly understood. Most
   studies focus on density-mediated trophic cascades, where removal of
   predators alternately causes increases and decreases in abundances of
   lower trophic levels. However, cascades could also be driven by where
   and when prey forage rather than solely by prey abundance. Over a large
   gradient of fishing intensity in the central Pacific's remote northern
   Line Islands, including a nearly pristine, baseline coral reef system,
   we found that changes in predation risk elicit strong behavioral
   responses in foraging patterns across multiple prey fish species. These
   responses were observed as a function of both short-term ({''}acute'')
   risk and longer-term ({''}chronic'') risk, as well as when prey were
   exposed to model predators to isolate the effect of perceived predation
   risk from other potentially confounding factors. Compared to numerical
   prey responses, antipredator behavioral responses such as these can
   potentially have far greater net impacts (by occurring over entire
   assemblages) and operate over shorter temporal scales (with potentially
   instantaneous response times) in transmitting top-down effects. A rich
   body of literature exists on both the direct effects of human removal of
   predators from ecosystems and predators' effects on prey behavior. Our
   results draw together these lines of research and provide the first
   empirical evidence that large-scale human removal of predators from a
   natural ecosystem indirectly alters prey behavior. These behavioral
   changes may, in turn, drive previously unsuspected alterations in reef
   food webs.},

Abstract = {Feces and distal gut contents were collected from three coral reef fish
   species. Bacteria cell abundances, as determined via epifluorescence
   microscopy, ranged two orders of magnitude among the fishes.
   Mass-specific and apparent cell-specific hydrolytic enzyme activities in
   feces from Chlorurus sordidus were very high, suggesting that endogenous
   fish enzymes were egested into feces. Denaturing gradient gel
   electrophoresis profiles of 16S rRNA genes were more similar among
   multiple individuals of the surgeonfish Acanthurus nigricans than among
   individuals of the parrotfish C. sordidus or the snapper Lutjanus bohar.
   Analyses of feces-derived 16S rRNA gene clones revealed that at least
   five bacterial phyla were present in A. nigricans and that Vibrionaceae
   comprised 10\% of the clones. Meanwhile, C. sordidus contained at least
   five phyla and L. bohar three, but Vibrionaceae comprised 71\% and 76\%
   of the clones, respectively. Many sequences clustered phylogenetically
   to cultured Vibrio spp. and Photobacterium spp. including Vibrio
   ponticus and Photobacterium damselae. Other Vibrionaceae-like sequences
   comprised a distinct phylogenetic group that may represent the presence
   of `feces-specific' bacteria. The observed differences among fishes may
   reflect native gut microbiota and/or bacterial assemblages associated

Journal = {EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS},
Year = {2003},
Volume = {210},
Number = {1-2},
Pages = {91-103},
Month = {MAY 15},
Abstract = {This study evaluates the accuracy of U/Th dates for young (< a few
   thousand years old) reef corals, both living and fossil, and explores
   strategies for refining those dates. The high precision of the U/Th
   method (+/-1-2\%) for dating young corals is well-established. Earlier
   studies have demonstrated the method's accuracy for select samples of
   known age. However, these studies have focused on typical samples that
   have extremely low Th-232 concentrations (tens of pg/ g). Here we study
   the dating systematics of young corals that have low but significant
   amounts of Th-232 (up to 1000 pg/g), indicating the presence of small
   fractions of non-radiogenic Th-230 (i.e. Th-230 not generated by in situ
   U decay). We report U/Th ages for living and subaerially exposed fossil
   corals from Palmyra Island, located in the central tropical Pacific,
   that range from 50 to 700 yr old. The Palmyra corals contain varying
   amounts of Th-232 and small fractions of associated non-radiogenic
   Th-230. Uncertainty associated with the correction for non-radiogenic
   Th-230 can lead to significant errors in U/Th dates. We have
   characterized non-radiogenic Th-230/Th-232 values, (Th-230/Th-232)(nr),
   as a means of minimizing this source of error. We calculate
   (Th-230/Th-232)(nr), values ranging from 0 to 2 X 10(-5) for the Palmyra
   living corals by comparing measured U/Th dates to absolute dates for the
   living coral, whose chronology is well-established. For the fossil
   corals, we employ three different approaches to arrive at
   (Th-230/Th-232)(nr) estimates. First, we compare measured U/Th dates to
   absolute dates in samples from a young fossil coral that overlaps the
   living coral. Next, we use the firm relative dating constraints imposed
   by five overlapping fossil corals from the 14th-15th centuries to
   calculate (Th-230/Th-232)(nr) values. Finally, we attempt to anchor the
   14th-15th century floating coral chronology to an absolute chronology by
   correlating the climate signals in the coral records to those in
   absolutely dated climate proxy records. All lines of evidence point to a
   range of (Th-230/Th-232)(nr) for fossil corals that overlaps the range
   determined for the living coral, suggesting that most of the thorium is
   primary or is added while the coral is still alive. Our work also
   demonstrates the utility of multiple (Th-230/Th-232)(nr) estimates. Most
   importantly, we demonstrate a method by which accurate (+/- 5 yr)
   U/Th-based chronologies can be obtained for young fossil corals with
   significant Th-232 concentrations.},

Title = {Automated 2D, 2.5D, and 3D Segmentation of Coral Reef Pointclouds and
   Orthoprojections},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ROBOTICS AND AI},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Month = {MAY 27},
Abstract = {Enabled by advancing technology, coral reef researchers increasingly
   prefer use of image-based surveys over approaches depending solely upon
   in situ observations, interpretations, and recordings of divers. The
   images collected, and derivative products such as orthographic
   projections and 3D models, allow researchers to study a comprehensive
   digital twin of their field sites. Spatio-temporally located twins can
   be compared and annotated, enabling researchers to virtually return to
   sites long after they have left them. While these new data expand the
   variety and specificity of biological investigation that can be pursued,
   they have introduced the much-discussed Big Data Problem: research labs
   lack the human and computational resources required to process and
   analyze imagery at the rate it can be collected. The rapid development
   of unmanned underwater vehicles suggests researchers will soon have
   access to an even greater volume of imagery and other sensor
   measurements than can be collected by diver-piloted platforms, further
   exacerbating data handling limitations. Thoroughly segmenting (tracing
   the extent of and taxonomically identifying) organisms enables
   researchers to extract the information image products contain, but is
   very time-consuming. Analytic techniques driven by neural networks offer
   the possibility that the segmentation process can be greatly accelerated
   through automation. In this study, we examine the efficacy of automated
   segmentation on three different image-derived data products: 3D models,
   and 2D and 2.5D orthographic projections thereof; we also contrast their
   relative accessibility and utility to different avenues of biological
   inquiry. The variety of network architectures and parameters tested
   performed similarly, similar to 80\% IoU for the genus Porites,
   suggesting that the primary limitations to an automated workflow are 1)
   the current capabilities of neural network technology, and 2)
   consistency and quality control in image product collection and human
   training/testing dataset generation.},

Title = {A Convolutional Neural Network for Automated Detection of Humpback Whale
   Song in a Diverse, Long-Term Passive Acoustic Dataset},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {08},
Month = {MAR 17},
Abstract = {Passive acoustic monitoring is a well-established tool for researching
   the occurrence, movements, and ecology of a wide variety of marine
   mammal species. Advances in hardware and data collection have
   exponentially increased the volumes of passive acoustic data collected,
   such that discoveries are now limited by the time required to analyze
   rather than collect the data. In order to address this limitation, we
   trained a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to identify humpback
   whale song in over 187,000 h of acoustic data collected at 13 different
   monitoring sites in the North Pacific over a 14-year period. The model
   successfully detected 75 s audio segments containing humpback song with
   an average precision of 0.97 and average area under the receiver
   operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) of 0.992. The model output was
   used to analyze spatial and temporal patterns of humpback song,
   corroborating known seasonal patterns in the Hawaiian and Mariana
   Islands, including occurrence at remote monitoring sites beyond
   well-studied aggregations, as well as novel discovery of humpback whale
   song at Kingman Reef, at 5(circle) North latitude. This study
   demonstrates the ability of a CNN trained on a small dataset to
   generalize well to a highly variable signal type across a diverse range
   of recording and noise conditions. We demonstrate the utility of active
   learning approaches for creating high-quality models in specialized
   domains where annotations are rare. These results validate the
   feasibility of applying deep learning models to identify highly variable
   signals across broad spatial and temporal scales, enabling new
   discoveries through combining large datasets with cutting edge tools.},

Title = {Possible control of acute outbreaks of a marine fungal pathogen by
   nominally herbivorous tropical reef fish},
Journal = {OECOLOGIA},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {193},
Number = {3},
Pages = {603-617},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Primary producers in terrestrial and marine systems can be affected by
   fungal pathogens threatening the provision of critical ecosystem
   services. Crustose coralline algae (CCA) are ecologically important
   members of tropical reef systems and are impacted by coralline fungal
   disease (CFD) which manifests as overgrowth of the CCA crust by fungal
   lesions causing partial to complete mortality of the CCA host. No
   natural controls for CFD have been identified, but nominally herbivorous
   fish could play a role by consuming pathogenic fungi. We documented
   preferential grazing on fungal lesions by adults of six common
   reef-dwelling species of herbivorous Acanthuridae and Labridae,
   (surgeonfish and parrotfish) which collectively demonstrated an similar
   to 80-fold higher grazing rate on fungal lesions relative to their
   proportionate benthic coverage, and a preference for lesions over other
   palatable substrata (e.g. live scleractinian coral, CCA, or algae).
   Furthermore, we recorded a similar to 600\% increase in live CFD lesion
   size over an approximately 2-week period when grazing by herbivorous
   fish was experimentally excluded suggesting that herbivorous reef fish
   could control CFD progression by directly reducing biomass of the fungal
   pathogen. Removal rates may be sufficient to allow CCA to recover from
   infection and explain historically observed natural waning behaviour
   after an outbreak. Thus, in addition to their well-known role as
   determinants of macroalgal overgrowth of reefs, herbivorous fish could
   thus also be important in control of diseases affecting crustose
   coralline algae that stabilize the foundation of coral reef substrata.},

Abstract = {Coral reefs are facing intensifying stressors, largely due to global
   increases in seawater temperature and decreases in pH. However, there is
   extensive environmental variability within coral reef ecosystems, which
   can impact how organisms respond to global trends. We deployed spatial
   arrays of autonomous sensors across distinct shallow coral reef habitats
   to determine patterns of spatiotemporal variability in seawater
   physicochemical parameters. Temperature and pH were positively
   correlated over the course of a day due to solar heating and
   light-driven metabolism. The mean temporal and spatial ranges of
   temperature and pH were positively correlated across all sites, with
   different regimes of variability observed in different reef types.
   Ultimately, depth was a reliable predictor of the average diel ranges in
   both seawater temperature and pH. These results demonstrate that there
   is widespread environmental variability on diel timescales within coral
   reefs related to water column depth, which needs to be included in
   assessments of how global change will locally affect reef ecosystems.},

Title = {Foraging consistency of coral reef fishes across environmental gradients
   in the central Pacific},
Journal = {OECOLOGIA},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {191},
Number = {2},
Pages = {433-445},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {We take advantage of a natural gradient of human exploitation and
   oceanic primary production across five central Pacific coral reefs to
   examine foraging patterns in common coral reef fishes. Using stomach
   content and stable isotope (delta N-15 and delta C-13) analyses, we
   examined consistency across islands in estimated foraging patterns.
   Surprisingly, species within the piscivore-invertivore group exhibited
   the clearest pattern of foraging consistency across all five islands
   despite there being a considerable difference in mean body mass (14
   g-1.4 kg) and prey size (0.03-3.8 g). In contrast, the diets and
   isotopic values of the grazer-detritivores varied considerably and
   exhibited no consistent patterns across islands. When examining foraging
   patterns across environmental contexts, we found that delta N-15 values
   of species of piscivore-invertivore and planktivore closely tracked
   gradients in oceanic primary production; again, no comparable patterns
   existed for the grazer-detritivores. The inter-island consistency in
   foraging patterns within the species of piscivore-invertivore and
   planktivore and the lack of consistency among species of
   grazer-detritivores suggests a linkage to different sources of primary
   production among reef fish functional groups. Our findings suggest that
   piscivore-invertivores and planktivores are likely linked to well-mixed
   and isotopically constrained allochthonous oceanic primary production,
   while grazer-detritivores are likely linked to sources of benthic
   primary production and autochthonous recycling. Further, our findings
   suggest that species of piscivore-invertivore, independent of body size,
   converge toward consuming low trophic level prey, with a hypothesized
   result of reducing the number of steps between trophic levels and
   increasing the trophic efficiency at a community level.},

Title = {Global biogeography of coral recruitment: tropical decline and
   subtropical increase},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {621},
Pages = {1-17},
Month = {JUL 4},
Abstract = {Despite widespread climate-driven reductions of coral cover on tropical
   reefs, little attention has been paid to the possibility that changes in
   the geographic distribution of coral recruitment could facilitate
   beneficial responses to the changing climate through latitudinal range
   shifts. To address this possibility, we compiled a global database of
   normalized densities of coral recruits on settlement tiles (corals
   m(-2)) deployed from 1974 to 2012, and used the data therein to test for
   latitudinal range shifts in the distribution of coral recruits. In
   total, 92 studies provided 1253 records of coral recruitment, with 77 \%
   originating from settlement tiles immersed for 3-24 mo, herein defined
   as long-immersion tiles (LITs); the limited temporal and geographic
   coverage of data from short-immersion tiles (SITs; deployed for <3 mo)
   made them less suitable for the present purpose. The results from LITs
   show declines in coral recruitment, on a global scale (i.e. 82\% from
   1974 to 2012) and throughout the tropics (85\% reduction at <20 degrees
   latitude), and increases in the sub-tropics (78\% increase at >20
   degrees latitude). These trends indicate that a global decline in coral
   recruitment has occurred since 1974, and the persistent reduction in the
   densities of recruits in equatorial latitudes, coupled with increased
   densities in sub-tropical latitudes, suggests that coral recruitment may
   be shifting poleward.},

Abstract = {Bolbometopon muricatum are ecologically unique mega-consumers in coral
   reef ecosystems. They primarily divide their dietary intake between
   living scleractinian corals and coral rock, a substrate richly colonized
   by non-coral biota. Here we examine how the chemical, structural, and
   energetic content of these two main classes of forage material may
   influence B. muricatum feeding behavior and selectivity. We then also
   examine nutrient content, pH, and alkalinity of the carbonate-rich feces
   of B. muricatum as a step toward understanding how B. muricatum
   defecation could affect reef nutrient dynamics and localized seawater
   chemistry. Our results suggest that by most measures, coral rock
   constitutes a richer food source than living corals, exhibiting higher
   levels of eight biologically relevant elements, and containing
   approximately three times greater caloric value than living corals.
   Additionally, the two forage types also presented distinct mineralogy,
   with the coral rock resembling a Mg-enriched carbonate phase in contrast
   to the primarily aragonitic live corals. Despite the fact that
   individual B. muricatum excrete tons of macerated coral annually, the
   low measured concentrations of N and P in feces suggest that this
   excretion may have relatively minor effects of reef macronutrient
   budgets. We also observed negligible local-scale impacts of B. muricatum
   feces on seawater pH and alkalinity. The approaches applied here
   integrate perspectives from marine biogeochemistry, materials science,
   and ecology. Collectively, these results provide preliminary insight
   into how reef chemistry could shape foraging of this dominant and
   vulnerable coral reef consumer and how it, in turn, might affect the
   chemistry of these reefs.},

Title = {Stable isotope analysis as an early monitoring tool for community-scale

Journal = {RESTORATION ECOLOGY},

Volume = {25},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Invasive rats have colonized most of the islands of the world, resulting
   in strong negative impacts on native biodiversity and on ecosystem
   functions. As prolific omnivores, invasive rats can cause local
   extirpation of a wide range of native species, with cascading
   consequences that can reshape communities and ecosystems. Eradication of
   rats on islands is now becoming a widespread approach to restore
   ecosystems, and many native island species show strong numerical
   responses to rat eradication. However, the effect of rat eradication on
   other consumers can extend beyond direct numerical effects, to changes
   in behavior, dietary composition, and other ecological parameters. These
   behavioral and trophic effects may have strong cascading impacts on the
   ecology of restored ecosystems, but they have rarely been examined. In
   this study, we explore how rat eradication has affected the trophic
   ecology of native land crab communities. Using stable isotope analysis
   of rats and crabs, we demonstrate that the diet or trophic position of
   most crabs changed subsequent to rat eradication. Combined with the
   numerical recovery of two carnivorous land crab species (Geograpsus
   spp.), this led to a dramatic widening of the crab trophic niche
   following rat eradication. Given the established importance of land
   crabs in structuring island communities, particularly plants, this
   suggests an unappreciated mechanism by which rat eradication may alter
   island ecology. This study also demonstrates the potential for stable
   isotope analysis as a complementary monitoring tool to traditional
   techniques, with the potential to provide more nuanced assessments of
   the community- and ecosystem-wide effects of restoration.},

Title = {Analysis of animal accelerometer data using hidden Markov models},
Journal = {METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {8},
Number = {2},
Pages = {161-173},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {1. Use of accelerometers is now widespread within animal biologging as
   they provide a means of measuring an animal's activity in a meaningful
   and quantitative way where direct observation is not possible. In
   sequential acceleration data, there is a natural dependence between
   observations of behaviour, a fact that has been largely ignored in most
   analyses.
   Analyses of acceleration data where serial dependence has been
   explicitly modelled have largely relied on hidden Markov models (HMMs).
   Depending on the aim of an analysis, an HMM can be used for state
   prediction or to make inferences about drivers of behaviour. For state
   prediction, a supervised learning approach can be applied. That is, an
   HMM is trained to classify unlabelled acceleration data into a finite
   set of pre-specified categories. An unsupervised learning approach can
   be used to infer new aspects of animal behaviour when biologically
   meaningful response variables are used, with the caveat that the states
   may not map to specific behaviours.
   We provide the details necessary to implement and assess an HMM in both
   the supervised and unsupervised learning context and discuss the data
   requirements of each case. We outline two applications to marine and
   aerial systems (shark and eagle) taking the unsupervised learning
   approach, which is more readily applicable to animal activity measured
   in the field. HMMs were used to infer the effects of temporal,
   atmospheric and tidal inputs on animal behaviour.
   Animal accelerometer data allow ecologists to identify important
   correlates and drivers of animal activity (and hence behaviour). The HMM
   framework is well suited to deal with the main features commonly
   observed in accelerometer data and can easily be extended to suit a wide
   range of types of animal activity data. The ability to combine direct
   observations of animal activity with statistical models, which account
   for the features of accelerometer data, offers a new way to quantify
   animal behaviour and energetic expenditure and to deepen our insights
   into individual behaviour as a constituent of populations and
   ecosystems.},

Title = {Global microbialization of coral reefs},
Journal = {NATURE MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {1},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Microbialization refers to the observed shift in ecosystem trophic
   structure towards higher microbial biomass and energy use. On coral
   reefs, the proximal causes of microbialization are overfishing and
   eutrophication, both of which facilitate enhanced growth of fleshy
   algae, conferring a competitive advantage over calcifying corals and
   coralline algae. The proposed mechanism for this competitive advantage
   is the DDAM positive feedback loop (dissolved organic carbon (DOC),
   disease, algae, microorganism), where DOC released by ungrazed fleshy
   algae supports copiotrophic, potentially pathogenic bacterial
   communities, ultimately harming corals and maintaining algal competitive
   dominance. Using an unprecedented data set of >400 samples from 60 coral
   reef sites, we show that the central DDAM predictions are consistent
   across three ocean basins. Reef algal cover is positively correlated
   with lower concentrations of DOC and higher microbial abundances. On
   turf and fleshy macroalgal-rich reefs, higher relative abundances of
   copiotrophic microbial taxa were identified. These microbial communities
   shift their metabolic potential for carbohydrate degradation from the
   more energy efficient Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway on coral-dominated
   reefs to the less efficient Entner-Doudoroff and pentose phosphate
   pathways on algal-dominated reefs. This `yield-to-power' switch by
   microorganism directly threatens reefs via increased hypoxia and greater
   CO2 release from the microbial respiration of DOC.},

Title = {Stable and sporadic symbiotic communities of coral and algal holobionts},

Abstract = {Coral and algal holobionts are assemblages of macroorganisms and
   microorganisms, including viruses, Bacteria, Archaea, protists and
   fungi. Despite a decade of research, it remains unclear whether these
   associations are spatial-temporally stable or species-specific. We
   hypothesized that conflicting interpretations of the data arise from
   high noise associated with sporadic microbial symbionts overwhelming
   signatures of stable holobiont members. To test this hypothesis, the
   bacterial communities associated with three coral species (Acropora
   rosaria, Acropora hyacinthus and Porites lutea) and two algal guilds
   (crustose coralline algae and turf algae) from 131 samples were analyzed
   using a novel statistical approach termed the Abundance-Ubiquity (AU)
   test. The AU test determines whether a given bacterial species would be
   present given additional sampling effort (that is, stable) versus those
   species that are sporadically associated with a sample. Using the AU
   test, we show that coral and algal holobionts have a high-diversity
   group of stable symbionts. Stable symbionts are not exclusive to one
   species of coral or algae. No single bacterial species was ubiquitously
   associated with one host, showing that there is not strict heredity of
   the microbiome. In addition to the stable symbionts, there was a
   low-diversity community of sporadic symbionts whose abundance varied
   widely across individual holobionts of the same species. Identification
   of these two symbiont communities supports the holobiont model and calls
   into question the hologenome theory of evolution.},

Journal = {NATURE},

Abstract = {Microbial viruses can control host abundances via density-dependent
   lytic predator-prey dynamics. Less clear is how temperate viruses, which
   coexist and replicate with their host, influence microbial communities.
   Here we show that virus-like particles are relatively less abundant at
   high host densities. This suggests suppressed lysis where established
   models predict lytic dynamics are favoured. Meta-analysis of published
   viral and microbial densities showed that this trend was widespread in
   diverse ecosystems ranging from soil to freshwater to human lungs.
   Experimental manipulations showed viral densities more consistent with
   temperate than lytic life cycles at increasing microbial abundance. An
   analysis of 24 coral reef viromes showed a relative increase in the
   abundance of hallmark genes encoded by temperate viruses with increased
   microbial abundance. Based on these four lines of evidence, we propose
   the Piggyback-the-Winner model wherein temperate dynamics become
   increasingly important in ecosystems with high microbial densities; thus
   `more microbes, fewer viruses'.},

Title = {Pelagic marine protected areas protect foraging habitat for multiple
   breeding seabirds in the central Pacific},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {181},
Pages = {226-235},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Despite many biotic, physical, and political challenges for place-based
   conservation in open ocean environments, conservation of discrete
   oceanic regions by designating pelagic marine protected areas (PMPAs)
   has gained considerable traction. In the oligotrophic central Pacific, a
   patchy and dynamic ecosystem, a robust network of PMPAs has recently
   been established. However, evaluations of PMPA efficacy in providing
   appropriate habitat coverage for pelagic species are lacking,
   particularly in the tropics. Here, we used high resolution GPS tracking
   and home range analyses of tropical boobies to determine the
   distribution and foraging habitat use of three sympatric species (Sula
   sub, Sula dactylatra, and Sula leucogaster) in two PMPAs that varied
   substantially in size and shape. At each site we characterized the
   extent and use of foraging habitat inside and outside the PMPA that
   surrounded each breeding colony. We found profound variation within and
   among species in foraging behavior and habitat use across the two sites;
   this was partially explained by variation in bathymetry. Yet, despite
   variation both in PMPA size and shape, and in foraging behavior of the
   birds, we determined that the PMPAs each encapsulated more than 85\% (n
   = 216 trips) of foraging habitat for each species, indicating that these
   PMPAs provided important habitat coverage for highly mobile tropical
   species. While this study highlights the challenges in effectively
   designing PMPAs even for relatively well-studied, central place
   foragers, given strong variation in foraging ecologies across sites, it
   also suggests that PMPAs do provide meaningful habitat coverage for at
   least some pelagic species. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {<list list-type={''}1{''} id={''}mee312255-list-0001{''}> Static sensor
   networks to observe animals are widely used in ecological, management
   and conservation research, but quantitative methods for designing these
   networks are underdeveloped. In the context of aquatic systems, we
   present a method for quasi-optimal network design, which accounts for
   blocking of detections by obstacles, horizontal and vertical movement
   behaviour of the target animals, and type of research question (is the
   network intended for estimation of detailed movement or home range?).
   Optimal design is defined as the sensor configuration that maximizes the
   expected number of unique animal detections. As finding the global
   optimum is generally time consuming, we use a greedy algorithm instead,
   which places sensors optimally relative to already placed sensors. The
   design method requires access to topographic data of the study site and
   knowledge of the sensor detection range. We illustrate the method with
   real topographic data from a rugose coral reef where network performance
   is highly influenced by detection shadowing. Network performance is
   visualized by a coverage map indicating the probability of detection at
   any location in the study area. The reported unique recovery rate
   summarizes the expected ability of the network to collect data given the
   design constraints. Because sensors are placed sequentially, the
   information gain per sensor can be evaluated and used as a proxy for
   sensor value. The presented method formalizes important considerations,
   when designing sensor networks, that were previously often based on
   heuristics and intuition. The method provides a guide to maximizing the
   information potential of future monitoring studies as well as a means to
   improve existing networks. The method is available as an R package and
   can be tested via an online web tool. <doi origin={''}wiley{''}

Abstract = {Holobionts are species-specific associations between macro-and
   microorganisms. On coral reefs, the benthic coverage of coral and algal
   holobionts varies due to natural and anthropogenic forcings. Different
   benthic macroorganisms are predicted to have specific microbiomes. In
   contrast, local environmental factors are predicted to select for
   specific metabolic pathways in microbes. To reconcile these two
   predictions, we hypothesized that adaptation of microbiomes to local
   conditions is facilitated by the horizontal transfer of genes
   responsible for specific metabolic capabilities. To test this
   hypothesis, microbial metagenomes were sequenced from 22 coral reefs at
   11 Line Islands in the central Pacific that together span a wide range
   of biogeochemical and anthropogenic influences. Consistent with our
   hypothesis, the percent cover of major benthic functional groups
   significantly correlated with particular microbial taxa. Reefs with
   higher coral cover had a coral microbiome with higher abundances of
   Alphaproteobacteria (such as Rhodobacterales and Sphingomonadales),
   whereas microbiomes of algae-dominated reefs had higher abundances of
   Gammaproteobacteria (such as Alteromonadales, Pseudomonadales, and
   Vibrionales), Betaproteobacteria, and Bacteriodetes. In contrast to
   taxa, geography was the strongest predictor of microbial community
   metabolism. Microbial communities on reefs with higher nutrient
   availability (e. g., equatorial upwelling zones) were enriched in genes
   involved in nutrient-related metabolisms (e. g., nitrate and nitrite
   ammonification, Ton/Tol transport, etc.). On reefs further from the
   equator, microbes had more genes encoding chlorophyll biosynthesis and
   photosystems I/II. These results support the hypothesis that core
   microbiomes are determined by holobiont macroorganisms, and that those
   core taxa adapt to local conditions by selecting for advantageous
   metabolic genes.},

Abstract = {Diseases threaten the structure and function of marine ecosystems and
   are contributing to the global decline of coral reefs. We currently lack
   an understanding of how climate change stressors, such as ocean
   acidification (OA) and warming, may simultaneously affect coral reef
   disease dynamics, particularly diseases threatening key reef-building
   organisms, for example crustose coralline algae (CCA). Here, we use
   coralline fungal disease (CFD), a previously described CCA disease from
   the Pacific, to examine these simultaneous effects using both field
   observations and experimental manipulations. We identify the associated
   fungus as belonging to the subphylum Ustilaginomycetes and show linear
   lesion expansion rates on individual hosts can reach 6.5 mm per day.
   Further, we demonstrate for the first time, to our knowledge, that
   ocean-warming events could increase the frequency of CFD outbreaks on
   coral reefs, but that OA-induced lowering of pH may ameliorate outbreaks
   by slowing lesion expansion rates on individual hosts. Lowered pH may
   still reduce overall host survivorship, however, by reducing
   calcification and facilitating fungal bio-erosion. Such complex,
   interactive effects between simultaneous extrinsic environmental
   stressors on disease dynamics are important to consider if we are to
   accurately predict the response of coral reef communities to future
   climate change.},

Abstract = {Positive density-dependent seed and seedling predation, where herbivores
   selectively eat seeds or seedlings of common species, is thought to play
   a major role in creating and maintaining plant community diversity.
   However, many herbivores and seed predators are known to exhibit
   preferences for rare foods, which could lead to negative
   density-dependent predation. In this study, we first demonstrate the
   occurrence of increased predation of locally rare tree species by a
   widespread group of insular seed and seedling predators, land crabs. We
   then build computer simulations based on these empirical data to examine
   the effects of such predation on diversity patterns. Simulations show
   that herbivore preferences for locally rare species are likely to drive
   scale-dependent effects on plant community diversity: at small scales
   these foraging patterns decrease plant community diversity via the
   selective consumption of rare plant species, while at the landscape
   level they should increase diversity, at least for short periods, by
   promoting clustered local dominance of a variety of species. Finally, we
   compared observed patterns of plant diversity at the site to those
   obtained via computer simulations, and found that diversity patterns
   generated under simulations were highly consistent with observed
   diversity patterns. We posit that preference for rare species by
   herbivores may be prevalent in low- or moderate-diversity systems, and
   that these effects may help explain diversity patterns across different
   spatial scales in such ecosystems.},

Abstract = {The El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) drives large changes in global
   climate patterns from year to year, yet its sensitivity to continued
   anthropogenic greenhouse forcing is uncertain. We analyzed fossil coral
   reconstructions of ENSO spanning the past 7000 years from the Northern
   Line Islands, located in the center of action for ENSO. The corals
   document highly variable ENSO activity, with no evidence for a
   systematic trend in ENSO variance, which is contrary to some models that
   exhibit a response to insolation forcing over this same period.
   Twentieth-century ENSO variance is significantly higher than average
   fossil coral ENSO variance but is not unprecedented. Our results suggest
   that forced changes in ENSO, whether natural or anthropogenic, may be
   difficult to detect against a background of large internal variability.},

Abstract = {The filamentous cyanobacterial genus Moorea gen. nov., described here
   under the provisions of the International Code of Botanical
   Nomenclature, is a cosmopolitan pan-tropical group abundant in the
   marine benthos. Members of the genus Moorea are photosynthetic
   (containing phycocyanin, phycoerythrin, allophycocyanin and chlorophyll
   a), but non-diazotrophic (lack heterocysts and nitrogenase reductase
   genes). The cells (discoid and 25-80 mu m wide) are arranged in long
   filaments (<10 cm in length) and often form extensive mats or blooms in
   shallow water. The cells are surrounded by thick polysaccharide sheaths
   covered by a rich diversity of heterotrophic micro-organisms. A
   distinctive character of this genus is its extraordinarily rich
   production of bioactive secondary metabolites. This is matched by
   genomes rich in polyketide synthase and non-ribosomal peptide synthetase
   biosynthetic genes which are dedicated to secondary metabolism. The
   encoded natural products are sometimes responsible for harmful algae
   blooms and, due to morphological resemblance to the genus Lyngbya, this
   group has often been incorrectly cited in the literature. We here
   describe two species of the genus Moorea: Moorea producens sp. nov.
   (type species of the genus) with 3L(T) as the nomenclature type, and
   Moorea bouillonii comb. nov. with PNG5-198(R) as the nomenclature type.},

Title = {Reef sharks and inshore habitats: patterns of occurrence and
   implications for vulnerability},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {460},
Pages = {115-125},
Abstract = {Reef sharks play important roles in tropical reef environments, but
   population declines have occurred in various locations including the
   Great Barrier Reef (GBR). While many reef shark studies focus on coral
   reefs, some reef sharks have been found across a range of inshore and
   coastal habitats. This study analyses fisheries observer data across
   large spatial scales (19 314 km(2)) to investigate the occurrence of
   reef sharks amongst a mosaic of inshore habitats in the GBR lagoon. Six
   reef shark species were recorded, but comprised a relatively small
   proportion (1.8\% by number) of the elasmobranch catch. The blacktip
   reef shark dominated the catch of reef sharks (60.2\% by number), with
   lemon sharks, zebra sharks, grey carpet sharks, whitetip reef sharks and
   grey reef sharks less frequently encountered. Reef sharks occur in
   several habitat types, and logistic regression models suggest that they
   are most likely to occur in reef habitats and shallow shore habitats.
   The presence of a reef within 2 km increased the encounter probability
   in all habitat types. While the use of these different habitats by reef
   sharks is not well understood, these habitat use patterns affect the
   exposure of these species to risks, including some risk factors not
   considered previously, and could also lead to cumulative impacts. These
   habitats may also perform important ecological functions in sustaining
   reef shark populations. Habitat use patterns should be considered in
   risk assessments and management and have important implications for
   method selection and survey design in field studies of reef sharks and
   other mobile reef species.},

Title = {Patterns of Coral Disease across the Hawaiian Archipelago: Relating
   Disease to Environment},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {6},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY 31},
Abstract = {In Hawaii, coral reefs occur across a gradient of biological (host
   abundance), climatic (sea surface temperature anomalies) and
   anthropogenic conditions from the human-impacted reefs of the main
   Hawaiian Islands (MHI) to the pristine reefs of the northwestern
   Hawaiian Islands (NWHI). Coral disease surveys were conducted at 142
   sites from across the Archipelago and disease patterns examined. Twelve
   diseases were recorded from three coral genera (Porites, Montipora,
   Acropora) with Porites having the highest prevalence. Porites growth
   anomalies (PorGAs) were significantly more prevalent within and
   indicative of reefs in the MHI and Porites trematodiasis (PorTrm) was
   significantly more prevalent within and indicative of reefs in the NWHI.
   Porites tissue loss syndrome (PorTLS) was also important in driving
   regional differences but that relationship was less clear. These results
   highlight the importance of understanding disease ecology when
   interpreting patterns of disease occurrence. PorTrm is caused by a
   parasitic flatworm that utilizes multiple hosts during its life cycle
   (fish, mollusk and coral). All three hosts must be present for the
   disease to occur and higher host abundance leads to higher disease
   prevalence. Thus, a high prevalence of PorTrm on Hawaiian reefs would be
   an indicator of a healthy coral reef ecosystem. In contrast, the high
   occurrence of PorGAs within the MHI suggests that PorGAs are related,
   directly or indirectly, to some environmental co-factor associated with
   increased human population sizes. Focusing on the three indicator
   diseases (PorGAs, PorTrm, PorTLS) we used statistical modeling to
   examine the underlying associations between disease prevalence and 14
   different predictor variables (biotic and abiotic). All three diseases
   showed positive associations with host abundance and negative
   associations with thermal stress. The association with human population
   density differed among disease states with PorGAs showing a positive and
   PorTrm showing a negative association, but no significant explanatory
   power was offered for PorTLS.},

Title = {Predators, facilitators, or both? Re-evaluating an apparent
   predator-prey relationship},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {431},
Pages = {299-302},
Abstract = {Predators and prey are occasionally observed to comingle in close
   proximity on coral reefs. Both lethal and non-lethal (i.e. behavioral)
   effects of predators on prey are well documented. However, observations
   of apparent predator-prey interactions between the piscivorous twinspot
   snapper Lutjanus bohar and the herbivorous surgeonfish Acanthurus
   triostegus suggest that the nature of their association may be
   context-dependent. The context-dependent nature of some species
   interactions is well-known, and in some cases a single species has been
   shown to act as both predator and facilitator to its prey. We present
   incidental in situ observations suggesting that, in the context of
   voraciously grazing schools of A. triostegus, this species pair may also
   engage in a facultative mutualistic relationship. Specifically, we
   propose that within this context, both species may indirectly derive a
   benefit through changes in the behavior and/or density of territorial
   damselfishes driven by both L. bohar and A. triostegus. We provide
   prescriptions for rigorously testing this hypothesis and suggest that
   re-evaluation of this, and possibly other, ostensibly exclusive
   predator-prey pairs in marine systems may reveal unexpected
   relationships. Given the relative lack of examples of such interactions
   involving the same predator acting as both facilitator and predator from
   marine versus terrestrial systems, coupled with this preliminary
   evidence, we propose that this topic is ripe for exploration.},

Title = {Spatial and temporal movement patterns of a multi-species coastal reef
   shark aggregation},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {429},
Pages = {261-U618},
Abstract = {The quantification of spatial and temporal movement patterns of coral
   reef sharks is important to understand their role in reef communities
   and to aid the design of conservation strategies for this predatory
   guild. We observed 4 species of reef sharks aggregating in an inshore
   bay in the north of Western Australia for over 2 yr, using acoustic
   telemetry and visual censuses to examine how they partitioned this site
   in space and time. We fitted 58 sharks with acoustic transmitters:
   Carcharhinus melanopterus (36), C. amblyrhynchos (11), Negaprion
   acutidens (7) and Triaenodon obesus (4). Aggregations consisted
   primarily of C. melanopterus, although C. amblyrhynchos and N. acutidens
   were often present. We observed aggregations by visual census in summer
   (maximum of 44 sharks). Detections were highest during warmer months
   (Sep to Mar) for all species, although some individuals showed
   year-round residency. C. melanopterus, C. amblyrhynchos and N. acutidens
   had strong diel patterns of attendance at the aggregation site. Peak
   daily detections occurred from 13: 00 to 14: 00 h local time for C.
   melanopterus and C. amblyrhynchos; juvenile C. melanopterus and N.
   acutidens peaked at 05:00 and 10:00 h, respectively. There was
   considerable spatial overlap of core areas of use (50\% kernel density
   estimates) at the northern end of the bay by all species; the southern
   end was used primarily by C. melanopterus and N. acutidens. Aggregations
   of C. melanopterus and C. amblyrhynchos consisted mainly of adult
   females, some of them pregnant. Courtship behaviour in C. melanopterus
   and T. obesus suggests that these aggregations are related to
   reproduction. All species displayed inter-annual site fidelity. The
   long-term presence of juvenile C. melanopterus and N. acutidens also
   suggests that this bay provides suitable conditions for younger age
   classes.},

Title = {Fishing Indirectly Structures Macroalgal Assemblages by Altering
   Herbivore Behavior},

Volume = {176},

Abstract = {Fishing has clear direct effects on harvested species, but its
   cascading, indirect effects are less well understood. Fishing
   disproportionately removes larger, predatory fishes from marine food
   webs. Most studies of the consequent indirect effects focus on
   density-mediated interactions where predator removal alternately drives
   increases and decreases in abundances of successively lower
   trophic-level species. While prey may increase in number with fewer
   predators, they may also alter their behavior. When such behavioral
   responses impact the food resources of prey species, behaviorally
   mediated trophic cascades can dramatically shape landscapes. It remains
   unclear whether this pathway of change is typically triggered by ocean
   fishing. By coupling a simple foraging model with empirical observations
   from coral reefs, we provide a mechanistic basis for understanding and
   predicting how predator harvest can alter the landscape of risk for
   herbivores and consequently drive dramatic changes in primary producer
   distributions. These results broaden trophic cascade predictions for
   fisheries to include behavioral changes. They also provide a framework
   for detecting the presence and magnitude of behaviorally mediated
   cascades. This knowledge will help to reconcile the disparity between
   expected and observed patterns of fishing-induced cascades in the sea.},

Title = {Niche partitioning among and within sympatric tropical seabirds revealed
   by stable isotope analysis},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {416},
Pages = {285-294},
Abstract = {The low productivity and unpredictable nature of resources in tropical
   waters would appear to make resource partitioning among predators
   difficult. Yet, stable isotope data from the present study suggest that
   substantial resource partitioning occurs among tropical seabird
   communities, both between and within species. In the present study, we
   compared delta C-13 and delta N-15 levels among 8 sympatric tropical
   seabird species. For a subset of these species, we also examined
   isotopic levels across years, breeding periods, and sexes. When breeding
   and non-breeding periods were both considered, we found that all species
   occupied distinct isotopic niches across at least one time period.
   Resource partitioning by age (within the same year) and year studied
   (for birds of the same age), within species was observed in all the
   species we examined. However, niche separation by sex appeared to be
   relatively uncommon even in sexually dimorphic species. As a group,
   seabirds were isotopically distinct from other marine predators. There
   was a strong correlation between both body mass and wing loading ratios
   and foraging area, as evaluated using delta C-13 levels. Cumulatively,
   the isotopic patterns observed are consistent with diet-based surveys of
   resource partitioning during the breeding period. Importantly, these
   data provide additional evidence to suggest that substantial niche
   partitioning among tropical seabird species persists even during
   non-breeding periods in open ocean environments, when direct diet-based
   surveys are difficult to conduct.},

Title = {Late 20th century warming and freshening in the central tropical Pacific},
Journal = {GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {36},
Month = {NOV 12},
Abstract = {Global climate models and analyses of instrumental datasets provide a
   wide range of scenarios for future tropical Pacific climate change,
   limiting the accuracy of regional climate projections. Coral records
   provide continuous reconstructions of tropical Pacific climate trends
   that are difficult to quantify using the short, sparse instrumental
   datasets available from the tropical Pacific. Here, we present
   coral-based reconstructions of late 20th century sea-surface temperature
   and salinity trends from several islands in the central tropical
   Pacific. The coral data reveal warming trends that increase towards the
   equator, implying a decrease in equatorial upwelling in the last
   decades. Seawater freshening trends on the southern edge of the
   Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone suggest a strengthening and/or an
   equatorward shift of the convergence zone. Together, the new coral
   records support a late 20th century trend towards ``El Nino-like{''}
   conditions in the tropical Pacific, in line with the majority of coupled
   global climate model projections. Citation: Nurhati, I. S., K. M. Cobb,

Journal = {MARINE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {155},
Number = {6},
Pages = {563-570},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Few studies have compared the underlying nature or structure of marine
   communities and assemblages across broad spatial scales, despite the
   importance of such comparisons in understanding global scale responses
   to environmental change and biodiversity conservation. The aim of this
   study was to examine the consistency of relationships between sponge
   abundance and richness on the undersides of boulders (to control for
   multiple confounding factors) in relation to space availability (boulder
   size) in three widely separated biogeographic regions. Sponges followed
   typical species-area (SA) relationships irrespective of site or ocean
   and we consistently found no decrease in sponge richness at larger
   boulder sizes. We also found reliable underlying density-area (DA)
   relationships, with larger boulders supporting more sponge patches at
   all sites. Although the general SA and DA relationships were similar
   between oceans and sites, the exact nature of these relationships in
   terms of the actual species present per unit area, total number of
   species present or density differed between sites. There were no
   consistent differences between SA and DA relationships at each locality,
   suggesting that although disturbance (particularly wave action) regimes
   may play an important role in controlling sponge biodiversity and
   abundance, its effects are manifested differently at local-scales. Even
   though boulders have received a considerable amount of research effort
   over the past three decades, this is the first study to examine the
   consistency of DA and SA relationships between ocean basins, finding
   similar relationships.},

Abstract = {The population structure of the most widely distributed anguillid eel,
   Anguilla marmorata, was evaluated using a statistical analysis of total
   number of vertebrae. A total of 1166 specimens from 13 representative
   localities in the Indo-Pacific region from Reunion Island to Tahiti and
   from New Caledonia to Japan were examined in this analysis that also
   included previously published data. The specimens from Micronesia showed
   a remarkable difference from those collected at the 12 other localities,
   and those from Tahiti showed a significant difference from those
   collected at ten other localities, but not New Caledonia and Samoa.
   Furthermore, significant differences were found between the North
   Pacific Ocean region, except Ambon Island, and South Pacific Ocean
   regions and Reunion island, while there were few differences between
   specimens from the Indian and South Pacific Ocean regions. It appears
   likely, based on this morphological analysis and the geographic range of
   this species, that there are at least four or more populations of A.
   marmorata as has been Indicated previously by molecular genetic
